<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N a recent work by an eminent man of science,
Dr. J. Reinke, Professor of Botany at the University
of Kiel, there occurs a passage which I cannot
do better than place in the forefront of this book as
an indication of its aim.</p>

<p class="quot">“Physiology,” writes Professor Reinke, “has become the
study of the movements which, taken together, make up
life. There is no manner of doubt that nourishment,
metabolism,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> reproduction, development, and sensation
rest on processes of movement which depend on material
systems of peculiar molecular conformation. For the
bodies of plants and of animals are material systems whose
conformation is of a most intricate character.<br /><br />
“So far as physiology has at present advanced in the
analysis of these phenomena of movement, their problems
have fallen naturally into two groups. The first of these
groups of phenomena is comparatively transparent, and
stands in agreement with the general processes of the
material world; it can be investigated by observation and
experiment. We may, therefore, hope to decipher it completely,
and to reduce it, in the end, to chemico-physical
processes. Of this kind are the phenomena of nutrition,
taking that word in its widest sense. But behind these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>processes there stand the facts of development and of
reproduction, and here, in all investigations, and in spite
of every attempt to demonstrate a basis of physical energy,
research finds itself confronted by an <i>X</i>, a factor which
mocks every effort to explain it by physics or chemistry.
And this <i>X</i> which lurks in all the phenomena of development
takes a part in the nutritive processes also; so
essential a factor does it appear in all the processes of life
that chemical and physical forces alone would not suffice to
keep alive even the most rudimentary of organisms, not to
mention creating such an organism out of non-living
chemical constituents.”<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>If this <i>X</i> force exists and can be established, it
will give us the clue, I believe, to much more than
the operations of physical nature. The following
pages are an attempt to establish it, to define its
character, and to indicate the lines on which this unknown
factor in evolution seems to bring into a
rational unity the phenomena of the physical world
and the moral and æsthetic faculties of man. The
time appears to have come for such an attempt. The
fermentation of mind produced by Darwin’s massive
and victorious promulgation of the evolution theory
is beginning to subside; it is now possible in some
measure to take stock of what has been destroyed, of
what has been left intact, by the immense tidal wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>of new thought which then swept over the world.
Some conceptions which were thought to have been
submerged for ever are reappearing in more or less
altered shapes, and science is called on to reconstruct
a universe less one-sided, less aridly simple,
than that which Darwinism, as at first understood,
appeared to have left us. The result, so far as it is
successful, will be the establishment of a spiritual
view of the universe on a natural basis. It is an
attempt which is at present occupying many minds,
and which will doubtless have to occupy many more
before complete success is attained.</p>

<p>I propose, in the following pages, to take the
reader over the most material and significant part of
the ground by which I have myself travelled towards
certain conclusions. Much of this ground lies in the
region of biological science. No doubt to readers
acquainted with that science I shall often seem to
delay too long in well-trodden and familiar paths.
But I have had to consider the fact that English
education is still very much specialized. It is either
literary or it is scientific. In the great majority of
cases it is literary. And though scientific problems
and theories are understood by every educated man
and woman to be of deep importance and interest,
and though questions like those discussed in the
present work are questions on which all such persons
are well entitled, and many feel themselves bound, to
have an opinion, very few, comparatively, have even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the elementary knowledge of science and its terminology
necessary to enable them to take up the
discussion at an advanced point. When it is announced
from time to time that some chemist has
again succeeded in forming an organic compound out
of inorganic chemical constituents in his laboratory,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
how many readers are there out of the small circle of
trained chemists who would not be far more impressed
if they heard that he had made a diamond?
It is for these persons—the layman and the lay-woman
in point of science—that I mainly write, and
my own training having been philosophical and
literary rather than scientific I think I understand
most of their difficulties. I have, therefore, tried to
‘begin at the beginning’; and I hope that this book,
besides whatever value its conclusions may have, will
prove useful to some readers by putting them in a
position to appreciate the extraordinarily interesting
and fruitful discoveries of biology in recent years.</p>

<p>“The lotus of physics,” as Schopenhauer says, “is
rooted in the soil of metaphysics,” and if these
studies pretended to offer a complete explanation of
the riddle of existence, the metaphysical basis for
the speculations contained in them would have to be
elaborated at considerable length. But, after all, the
conclusions reached would only be those which most
people are willing to accept as a necessary assumption,
if all thought on the constitution of the universe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>is not to be a pure futility. Suffice it to say Man is
here regarded as an organic part of Nature, and his
consciousness as Nature’s way of mirroring herself to
herself. Since, like other natural things, the soul is
not a complete and unalterable entity, but is part of
the eternal Becoming, it never can be claimed that its
reflection of the world is absolutely pure and complete,
yet some reality, some significance this reflection must
surely have. The fact that man is not something
different from the world, observing it from outside,
but is vitally related to it, would alone entitle us to
believe that, however much his observations may
need to be purified and corrected, and however false
may be the argumentative deductions sometimes
drawn from them, he is still capable of a real and
fruitful apprehension of the phenomena by which he
is surrounded, and of their relations to each other and
to himself. All sincere thought must therefore tend
to brighten a little the mirror of the human soul. If
this book should do so in any degree, were it merely
by provoking other minds to more successful labours,
the writer will thankfully say, like Apollo’s temple-sweeper
in the play of Euripides, Fair is the service
of Light.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="center">THE ARGUMENT FROM DESIGN</p>

<p class="indent f85">“The wisdom of the divine rule is apparent not in the perfection
but in the improvement of the world.”—<span class="smcap">Lord Acton.</span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ALEY’S <span class="smcap">Natural Theology</span> though not by any
means an epoch-making may perhaps be called
an epoch-marking book. It was the crown of
the endeavour of eighteenth-century religious philosophy
to found a theology on the evidences of
external nature. According to such exact knowledge
of Nature’s operations as was then generally available,
Paley’s attempt might well be thought to have
succeeded. He opens his argument with a striking
and effective illustration. He imagines a wayfarer
crossing a heath who strikes his foot against a stone,
and who asks himself how it came into being.
Paley thinks he might be content with vaguely
supposing that it was there ‘always.’ But suppose
that what he had found at his foot was not a stone
but a watch and that he now saw such an instrument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
for the first time. He would then certainly have not
been so easily contented with an answer to the riddle
of its existence. He would, if he examined it
minutely, have observed that it was a structure
intended for a certain purpose, and having all its
parts arranged for that object, and mutually interdependent
The different substances of which it was
composed would be discovered to have each its special
appropriateness for the fulfilling of some particular
function in the economy of the whole. Though
unacquainted with watches he would, if he was a man
of sense and cultivation, infallibly conclude that he
had before him an instrument intelligently constructed
with a certain object in view—the object of
measuring the flight of time. He would feel assured
of this, even though he should find that the object
of the mechanism were not attained with absolute
accuracy, and even though there were some parts of
it whose functions were not clear to him. The watch
would be rightly regarded as a work of design; and
the observer would be justified in arguing from it to
the existence of a designer, endowed with the faculties
of intelligence and conscious purpose, by whom
the watch must have been put together.</p>

<p>The rest of Paley’s <span class="smcap">Natural Theology</span> is an
application of this analogy to the question of the
origin of the universe. Ranging over the whole
field of animate and inanimate nature he points to
instance after instance of what appears to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
minute and thoughtful adaptation of means to ends,
the co-ordination of part with part in the interest
of the whole, and he has no difficulty, from this point
of view, in showing the world of nature to be a piece
of mechanism far more wonderfully and ingeniously
constructed than any watch, and bearing <i>prima facie</i>
evidence of the most convincing kind of its construction
by a Being possessed of intelligence,
purpose and foresight precisely resembling those
attributes as displayed by man, but vastly heightened
and enlarged. As the watch must have been made
by man, so a manlike being, endowed with the necessary
powers and faculties, must be postulated as the
maker of the material universe. And thus the existence
of a God made in the image of man appeared
to have been demonstrated to the satisfaction of
eighteenth-century theology.</p>

<p>But minds of real philosophic depth have always
shrunk from pressing home deductions of this sort.
They have felt that the matter is probably not
quite so simple as it might appear on the surface, and
they have recognised that if one is allowed to argue
from the phenomena of nature to the qualities of the
author of nature one cannot draw an arbitrary line
including only those facts which testify to wisdom,
power and goodness, and excluding from view all
those which reveal imperfection of design and execution,
or which would convict a man, if he were their
author, of inhumanity and injustice. If the universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
is really analogous to a watch one is entitled to
examine it throughout as one would examine a watch.
All watches testify to intelligence and design, but
besides good watches there are bad ones, there are
those which are made of cheap materials, rudely put
together, with showy exteriors and unreliable works.
Every watch, if examined by experts in mechanism,
in art, and so forth, would reveal the characteristics
of its designer and maker, and these characteristics
would not always be admirable. They would rarely,
in fact, be altogether admirable. If we apply these
methods of inquiry to a universe which contains
malarial mosquitoes, slave-making ants, snakes, earthquakes,
and all the pests which blight and deform
life without calling forth any strong or noble qualities
to carry on the contest with them, we shall go
where Paley certainly never intended to lead us, but
we shall go there by Paley’s road. The fact is that
these methods are altogether fantastic and inapplicable.
The universe is not made like a watch. When
we observe a human being or one of the higher
animals we say, ‘He has such and such qualities; he
is faithful, false, brave, cowardly, diligent, indolent,
strong, weak, beautiful or ugly,’ but we do not think
of referring his qualities back to certain attributes
of an unknown maker of his physical and mental
organism. A philosophy worthy of the name has
always tended to regard the world as in some sense
a vital organism, and has asked ‘What is it?’ rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
than ‘What does it prove about some other being?’
“How green must be the maker of all grass” was
quite a legitimate satire on all such attempts to deduce
the qualities of a hypothetical creator from the
phenomena of the universe. Thus the mistake of
Paley and his school was fundamental. It was the
mistake of seeking God in fragmentary phenomena—the
same mistake, essentially, as that rebuked by
Christ, by which every calamity or material blessing
is regarded as a ‘judgment’ or a reward. His method,
if applied with thorough-going consistency, destroys
its own basis, for the One and the Many, the Whole
and the Parts, cannot be apprehended at one and the
same time by one and the same faculty of any
human mind. Looking at phenomena alone, and
thinking in that sphere, we cannot say that God
made the world but rather that the world is becoming
divine. Philosophically and religiously, God is
all in all—historically, He is not the beginning, He
is rather the end, the end in which the whole history
is resumed.</p>

<p class="tb">Paley’s elaborate argument was felt by the orthodox
of his time to be called for, even though at this
period his way of thinking was popular. The conception
of the world as a vital organism was as yet,
indeed, very vague, and unsupported by any detailed,
scientific scrutiny of the facts of nature, but it was in
the air—it had always been in the air; it always held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the minds of cautious students back from a complete
surrender to the facile but illusory way of thinking
typified by Paley’s famous analogy of the universe
and the watch. Bacon knew that species could be
transformed by the action of a new environment.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
Goethe had a clear conception of the evolution theory,
based on a study of organic structure. Erasmus
Darwin, in 1794, had uttered the great and final
word: “The world has been generated rather than
created.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Lamarck’s Philosophie Zoologique was
not published till 1809, nine years after Paley’s
Natural Theology, but his conception of the development
of special characteristics by habitual exercise
and their transmission by inheritance had been
freely mooted in Paley’s day, for Paley frequently
takes occasion to combat it. Even the conception
of natural selection as an agency in the formation of
types of being may be traced in a fantastic form as
far back as to Empedocles,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> while Plato, or whoever
composed a striking couplet attributed to him in
the Greek Anthology, had divined the plasticity of
natural forms. “Time,” he wrote, “sways the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>world; time has power in its prolonged lapse to
change the names and shapes, the nature and the
destiny of things.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>Fifty years after the appearance of Paley’s work,
the grandson of Erasmus Darwin wrote ‘No thoroughfare’
on the entrance to Paley’s line of speculation,
and closed it to mankind for ever. He did this in
two ways—first by marshalling from his studies of
comparative anatomy and of embryology an extraordinary
volume of convincing evidence for the <i>fact</i>
of the mutability of natural forms, and secondly by
his attempt to establish a plausible <i>method</i> by which
the change and development of organs and types
might actually have taken place. The method,
summed up in the phrases ‘natural selection’ and
‘survival of the fittest,’ was what really caught the
attention of the world, and gave his doctrine the
wings which carried it into almost every sphere of
human thought. However we take it, it was certainly
an immense contribution to the organization
of knowledge, but whether it is really what it first
seemed to be, the basic fact at the bottom of all
the phenomena of evolution, is coming to look more
and more doubtful in the light of later researches.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>This question will have to be considered later on
in the course of this study, and in relation to its
main inquiry, which is this: What precisely was the
change in philosophic and religious outlook brought
about by the full and final establishment of the
doctrine of evolution? Where has evolution left
the argument from design? Must we study nature
as a mass of unrelated phenomena, or can we discern,
through these, any fundamental unity to which
they stand in organic relation; and if we can, what
is the nature of this unity?</p>

<p class="tb">It will be useful in the first place to have before
us a typical specimen of Paley’s method. I shall
choose as an example the case which he considered
so striking that he deemed it almost sufficient
in itself to bear the whole weight of his argument
In his ninth chapter, ‘On the Muscles,’ he
writes:—</p>

<p class="quot">“The next circumstance which I shall mention under
this head of muscular arrangement is so decisive a mark of
intention, that it always appeared to me to supersede, in
some measure, the necessity of seeking for any other observation
upon the subject; and that circumstance is, the
tendons which pass from the leg to the foot being bound
down by a ligament to the ankle. The foot is placed at a
considerable angle with the leg. It is manifest, therefore,
that flexible strings, passing along the interior of the angle,
if left to themselves, would, when stretched, start from it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
The obvious preventive is to tie them down. And this is
done, in fact. Across the instep, or rather just above it,
the anatomist finds a strong ligament, <i>under</i> which the
tendons pass to the foot. The effect of the ligament as a
bandage can be made evident to the senses; for if it be
cut, the tendons start up. The simplicity, yet the clearness
of this contrivance, its exact resemblance to established
resources of art, place it amongst the most indubitable
manifestations of design with which we are acquainted.<br /><br />
“There is also a further use to be made of the present
example, and that is, as it precisely contradicts the opinion
that the parts of animals may have been formed by what is
called <i>appetency</i>, <i>i.e.</i> endeavour perpetuated and imperceptibly
working its effect through an incalculable series of
generations. We have here no endeavour but the reverse of
it—a constant renitency and reluctance. The endeavour is
all the other way. The pressure of the ligament constrains
the tendons; the tendons react upon the pressure of the
ligament. It is impossible that the ligament should ever
have been generated by the exercise of the tendon, or in the
course of that exercise, forasmuch as the force of the
tendon perpendicularly resists the fibre, which confines it,
and is constantly endeavouring not to form, but to rupture
and displace, the threads of which the ligament is composed.”</p>

<p>Paley’s account of the function of the annular
ligament at the ankle is correct, and strikingly put.
A similar ligament occurs at the wrist, and navvies
who have hard muscular work to do in digging and
shovelling are wont to reinforce this ligament and
to keep it from rupture by a leather strap round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wrist. The strap performs exactly the same function
as the ligament, and from Paley’s point of view one
is as artificial, as much a ‘contrivance,’ as the other.
But his point of view is wrong. He conceives the
Creator as having at his disposal fully formed elements
or materials—sinews, bones, ligaments, and the
like—and assembling them into a working mechanism.
In fact, however, none of these things is now
what it was originally—time, as Plato says, has
changed its “name and shape.” The annular ligaments
are recognized by modern anatomists as
having originated in special thickenings of the
fascial sheaths of the adjoining muscles of the wrist
and ankle. They had a function which was not
originally connected with keeping down the long
tendons that run along the interior angle of
the leg and foot. Contractility, as biologists tell
us, is a fundamental property of living protoplasm;
and it is easy to imagine that, at the very
beginning of the formation of muscular structure
and bone articulation, two lines of contractile force
might cross each other and thus permit the gradual
evolution of the present arrangement, nature continually
visiting with disability and extinction those
individuals in whom the resisting power of the
muscles which were eventually to form the annular
ligament was unduly feeble, and giving a better
chance of life, and of the propagation of their kind,
to those in whom it was strong. The instance, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
fact, is one of those in which the explanation of
development by natural selection is most obvious
and plausible.</p>

<p>In his second paragraph Paley touches on the
theory of “appetency,” the supposed tendency of
natural structure to alter and adapt itself on the
lines indicated by the actual exercise of function,
and in consequence of that exercise. This is practically
the theory since identified with the name of
Lamarck. Paley scarcely does it justice, for no
Lamarckian would suggest that a muscle could, in
the course of its exercise, develop the ligament
whose function is to restrain it. The ligament
would be developed by its own exercise. But as
Lamarckism will be discussed later on, the issue as
between these rival theories need not be debated
here.</p>

<p>Let us set beside Paley’s argument on the annular
ligament of the ankle a passage from a modern
scientific work, Strasburger’s <span class="smcap">Text Book of Botany</span>.
It will introduce us, from the side of the strictest
scientific observation and of the fullest acceptance
of the evolution theory, to the same kind of problems
as those discussed in Paley’s <span class="smcap">Natural
Theology</span>, and it will raise in a very distinct and
unevadable fashion the question, what we are to think
of the power manifested in the operations of Nature.
In the introduction to his work, in which Dr. Strasburger
had associated with him three other eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
German botanists, we find the following remarkable
passage dealing with circumstances observed to exist
in the ‘phylogenetic’ or tribal (as opposed to the
‘ontogenetic’ or individual) history of plant species:—</p>

<p class="quot">“Although the great importance of natural selection
in the development of the organic world has been fully
recognised by most naturalists, the objection has been
raised that it alone is not a sufficient explanation of all
the different processes in the phylogeny of an organism.
Attention has been called to such organs as would be
incapable of exercising their function until in an advanced
stage of development, and so could not originally have
been of any advantage in a struggle for existence. How
could natural selection tend to develop an organ which
would be useless so long as it was still in a rudimentary
condition? This objection has led to the supposition
of an internal force residing in the substance of the
organisms themselves and controlling their development
in certain definite directions. Many naturalists indeed
have gone so far as to affirm that only the less advantageous
qualities have been affected by the struggle for
existence, while the more advantageous have been uninfluenced
by it”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>One can easily imagine what a modern Paley bent
on reconciling orthodoxy and evolution would say to
this. He would cry, Design, forethought, intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>—here
is the clearest evidence of it! And indeed
there are many modern biologists who do not shrink
from the admission that the processes of nature must
ultimately be interpreted in terms of will or intention,
not in terms of chance or blind mechanism.
Thus, to the Darwinian argument that organs can
be and are, demonstrably, formed by gradual adaptation
to surrounding conditions without assuming the
necessity of purposeful design, it is often replied that
the very fact of adaptability is itself one of the
strongest evidences if not of design at least of purpose.
And J. v. Uexküll, who describes life as consisting
essentially in the fact that it proceeds according
to design (<i>planmässig</i>), has the following remarkable
passage in his <span class="smcap">Experimental Biology</span><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>:—</p>

<p class="quot">“When we look backwards, every phase in the process
of development seems to us to have proceeded in a strictly
causal manner from physico-chemical processes. But when
we turn to look forward, it is certain that the physico-chemical
processes if left to their own causality must
immediately bring about the destruction of the organism.
In fact, the clearest definition we can give of dying is to
say of an organism that its processes now go on no longer
teleologically (<i>zweckmässig</i>) but only causally.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the modern Paley would be rash in arguing
from facts like these (supposing them fully established)
to the conscious, intelligent contrivance of
a single foreseeing Mind. For very few things in
this universe appear to be done as a presiding,
conscious intelligence would do them. Conscious
intelligence would not have evolved the giant armadillo
only that the whole species might be destroyed
by the sabre-toothed tiger, and would not have
armed the sabre-toothed tiger for the attack on the
armadillo in such a way that when he had exterminated
the victim-species the formation of
his teeth rendered it impossible for him to prey on
any other animal.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Conscious intelligence would
not have allowed the relic of a disused organ, in
the shape of the vermiform appendix, to be a constant
source of danger and suffering to countless
generations of men—danger against which no exercise
of prudence or energy can secure them.</p>

<p>Let us examine a couple of other crucial cases.
The embryo of every mammalian animal is prepared
in the womb for the life it is to live under
wholly different conditions. Lungs are formed when
there is no air for them to breathe, eyes when there
is no light, a digestive system when nourishment is
derived as yet direct from the mother’s blood. This
capacity for anticipatory development during a period
of gestation or incubation becomes absolutely neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>sary
for the maintenance of life as soon as animals,
ceasing to multiply by merely dividing in two, become
more highly organized and have to devote special
germ-cells to reproductive purposes. Here is certainly
purpose, or, as I should prefer to call it, <i>directivity</i>—here
we recognize what Reinke calls the
X-factor in nature. But conscious, intelligent contrivance?
We must recollect how many of these
embryos are destined to perish at birth or before
attaining any appreciable degree of independent life.
Would not intelligence foresee that, and bring to
birth only what was destined to endure?</p>

<p>Again, there are certain species of butterflies which
have put on a coloration and a form the effect of
which is to aid them in evading the attacks of birds.
They were not created so; they have become so;
and the precise manner of the becoming will be fully
discussed in a later chapter. Let us assume for the
moment that this adaptation did not occur by a
series of lucky accidents or by any merely mechanical
process. Are we, then, bound to attribute it to
intelligent contrivance? The question will be best
answered by simply putting a case which admits
of no doubt. Suppose there were an island in
which there were no birds, except such as prey on
fishes or on each other, but never on insects. The
butterflies on this island, if there were any, would
certainly show no trace of protective form or coloration.
But at some time or other insect-eating birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
might be introduced to the island, as the English
sparrow has been introduced in Australia. Then,
if the extermination of the butterflies did not proceed
too rapidly, we might expect, in the course of
generations, to see protective adaptations assumed.
But could we expect to see them assumed <i>in anticipation</i>
of the advent of the destroyers? We could not.
Naturalists, however much they may differ, as they
do differ, upon the question as to how protective
adaptations actually take place, would all agree that
they could not possibly take place in anticipation of
needs not yet present. If they did, we should have
a miracle, and where miracle comes in knowledge
goes out. The cases where conscious, intelligent contrivance
would be unmistakably recognizable are just
the cases which never occur. The signal service
rendered by the champions of the evolution theory,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Quos nec fama Deûm, nec fulmina, nec minitanti</div>
<div class="line">Murmure compressit Cœlum,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>is that they conquered the realm of organic nature
for true knowledge, and gave the drama of its development
a new and profound interest, by showing
with an uncompromising courage only equalled by
the extraordinarily minute and patient research which
justified it, that the <i>apparent</i> instances of divine
contrivance with which nature teems must be explained
by the responsiveness, the adaptability, of
living protoplasm. Needless to say, this demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
does not in the least <i>disprove</i> the existence of God as
a supreme, conscious, personal Intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> But it
does forbid us to deduce the existence of such a
Being from the observation of natural phenomena.
A living, developing universe has been set in the
place of a Divine Mechanician operating on dead
matter.</p>

<p class="tb">The question, what conception we are to form of
the forces of evolution, will be more fully discussed
in the succeeding chapters on Biology, as a foundation
for views which will afterwards be put forward
in relation to Ethics and to Art.</p>

<p>But first we must clear the ground a little by considering
what it really is that we are to study, and if
it be possible to study it at all. Nature-study if it
is to be possible must begin, and if it is to be fruitful
must end, in something which is not strictly the
study of nature, but which we call Philosophy.</p>

<p>One of the most brilliant examples of that union
of philosophic speculation with nature-study which
is so marked a feature of the German thought of
our day is H. von Keyserling’s work, <span class="smcap">The Structure
of the World</span>.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Keyserling begins by laying it
down as a postulate of thinking that “The Universe
is a rounded, inwardly coherent Whole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>A postulate of thinking this is indeed, and more
than that—it is a postulate of living. If under all the
variety and apparent discontinuity of the universe
there does not lie <i>One</i> all-pervading and unifying
Power, then meditation and action are alike vain, for
none can tell the hour when some incursion of the
unknown may not shatter our cosmos into chaos, or
leave us in a new universe with the edifice of our
past experience, the familiar home of the spirit, lying
in ruins around us. Every one assumes, consciously
or unconsciously, that there is such a Power, that the
universe is One, that however mysterious, however
little known or understood it may be, it is not essentially
deceptive or incalculable. The savage and the
philosopher alike assume this, and act upon the
assumption. It is perhaps possible not merely to
assume but to prove it. For let us try to imagine
what would be the case if it were not true. If the
Principle, the ultimate Reality of the universe, be not
one it must be at least dual. There must be not less
than two principles. Now there are only three ways
in which these two principles—and what we say will
hold good for any greater number—can be related to
each other. They must either (1) be identical, or
(2) they must be complementary, each possessing
something which the other is lacking in, or (3) they
must negate each other and be mutually contradictory
and exclusive. But two absolutely identical
principles, if we can conceive such a thing, are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>distinguishable
from one. Two or more complementary
principles, again, make up, when taken together,
but a single whole, as in the Christian Trinity. Therefore
if the universe be really dual, its two principles
must negate and contradict each other. Now these
two hostile principles must either be equal in force or
one must be more powerful than the other. In the
latter event, seeing that they divide between them
the sum total of existence and thus stand in naked
and essential antagonism, with no place for evasion,
and no auxiliary or modifying forces to call in, it
follows of necessity that if one surpassed the other
by even the smallest conceivable excess, it must, in
eternity, master it and reduce it to impotence. So by
this road we come back to unity again. If, however,
we suppose our two forces to be co-equal and co-eternal,
we have to ask ourselves what we mean by
supposing them to be antagonistic. Antagonism can
only arise when there is action. But two equal forces
acting in direct contradiction to each other must
mutually cancel each other, and the result is zero.
On such an hypothesis the universe could never have
come into being. It may also be pointed out that the
hypothesis itself seems to be irrational. For action
means the production of a change of some kind,
change in the nature or situation of objects. But if
one of our forces is producing changes of a certain
kind and the other producing changes of another
kind, then they are not contradictory but comple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>mentary.
The only real antagonism between two
ultimate principles must consist in one of them
being identified with action, change, life, the other
with immobility and death. But a principle of immobility
and death, if there could be such a thing,
could not also be a principle of action, not even of
destructive action, for to act at all would be a contradiction
of its own nature. It would begin and
end in total <i>in</i>action, and the field would be clear for
the other Power, just as if nothing else existed. It
follows that, in the living and moving universe around
us, there cannot be any such thing as an active
principle of destruction and death. We are obliged
to perceive Being under the guise of Becoming and
Becoming under the guise of Change and Progression.
This is a process taking place in the visible and
temporal order of things and capable, under certain
conditions, of partial arrest or retrogression. But the
Whole, regarded as a whole, can be and can contain
nothing but life, and must under all its diversity
(which is an aspect of life) be One. It is this unity
which alone can make intelligible and rational the
diversity of which every study of life must treat. It
is my endeavour in the present work to bring into
clear light some important aspects of this unity, as
revealed in the inter-relations of the parts of which,
to our eyes, it seems to be composed.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has long been known that no definite line of
demarcation can be drawn between the animal
and the vegetable worlds. There are lowly organisms
which cannot be decisively referred either to the
one or to the other. It has been more recently shown
that the apparently more strongly marked line
between the living and the non-living also grows
wavering and indistinct in places. Metals are known
to respond to stimuli and to show ‘fatigue’ in a
manner commonly attributed only to the nervous
system of animals,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> while some of the phenomena of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>crystallization strongly resemble those of vitality.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
Le Dantec has uttered the latest word of physics on
this subject, where he insists on the “absence of all
essential difference and all absolute discontinuity between
living and non-living matter.”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Indeed, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>may say of nature-study in general, that if, as Plato
said, the beginning of knowledge is in definitions and
classification, the end of it lies in getting rid of them.
There is probably no such thing as a universally applicable
definition of any group of natural phenomena.
<i>There is certainly no condition of matter of which we are
entitled to say that Life is impossible without it.</i> Still,
natural groups have well-marked central features,
even if at their margins they melt into something
else. Now the things which in the ordinary sense
of the word we call Living are marked by these
characters: Their chemical constituents are always
compounds of carbon. These compounds are what
is called ‘unstable’—they ‘consume’ or disintegrate
by combining with oxygen in air or water. In this
process organisms obtain the energy necessary for
assimilation and growth. The above characters
(carbon-compounds, chemical instability, and faculty
of assimilation) apply to plants and animals alike.
But we find, in general, that plants are able, from
inorganic mineral constituents such as carbonic
acid, water, nitrates, sulphates, etc.,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> to build up
the organic compounds like proteid, albumin, the
carbohydrates, alcohol, fat; while animals use for
their nourishment not the inorganic substances but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>only organic compounds already formed by plants or
by other animals. A well-developed vegetable world
must therefore, it would seem, have preceded the
appearance of animal life on the globe.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It was long
believed that these organic compounds of carbon
could only be formed by the vital action of living
vegetation. One of the epochs in the history of
modern chemistry has been the demonstration
(first by Wöhler, in 1828,) that many of them
can be produced in the laboratory from inorganic
chemical constituents. But this is only effected by
circuitous and difficult ways, and—a circumstance
often overlooked—it only resembles what is accomplished
in nature if we include under nature
the directive agency represented by the chemist
himself, as well as the materials with which he
deals.</p>

<p>The characteristic colour of living vegetation is
green. This is also the rarest of colours among the
higher animals.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It is due in vegetables to the
presence in their cells of grains of the substance
known as chlorophyll, which very few animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>possess or have need of. It is developed normally
under the action of sunlight, and plays a most
important part in the economy of the plant. The
usual method by which any organism obtains the
energy necessary for its vital functions is through the
oxidization, <i>i.e.</i> the slow burning, of its substance, by
combination with the oxygen of the air. The process
is to all intents the same as the more rapid oxidization,
under great heat, of coal in a steam-engine.
If a plant can obtain sugar, which oxidizes easily in
contact with atmospheric oxygen, it has thus a fund
of energy to draw on for all the processes of its life.
Now sugar is composed of carbon and water. Carbon
exists in the air, in combination with oxygen, in
the form known as carbonic acid. Chlorophyll, in
some way as yet unexplained, enables plants, when
acted upon by light, to take in carbonic acid from
the air and to disintegrate it into its constituents,
carbon and oxygen. The oxygen disappears again
in the air, and the released carbon combines with
water in the plant to form sugar,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> thus giving the
plant its needed store of potential energy. All it
does with this energy is to live, grow, and reproduce
its kind; till at length a time comes when the
assimilative energy weakens relatively to the forces of
decay, and the plant dies; it is again resolved into
the chemical constituents from which it was built
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>up; but not without having passed on the flame of
life to burn afresh in its descendants.</p>

<p>Plants which have no chlorophyll, like certain
bacteria and moulds, and which, therefore, cannot decompose
the carbonic acid in the air for their nourishment,
offer an interesting example of the manner in
which Nature contrives to get her way, if not by the
normal instruments, then by the utilization of others.
They acquire their first store of energy sometimes
like animals, from other organic compounds, or they
take carbon from acetates and tartrates. The nitro-bacteria
appear to depend on ammonia derived from
decaying animal matter, and the moulds draw their
energy from sugar, which (as in our jams, etc.) they
find already formed.</p>

<p>There are other plants, such as the fly-eating
<i>Drosera</i>, which feed upon organic substances with
the aid of digestive juices, exactly as animals do;
and there are animals, such as <i>Hydra</i> and others,
of very primitive form,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> which produce chlorophyll
and are thereby enabled, like plants, to feed upon
carbonic acid. The distinction therefore which has
been drawn between the two kingdoms as regards
their modes of nourishment must, like other definitions
of natural groups, be taken to apply to
central and typical forms and not to constitute a
distinct boundary line. Allowing for these exceptional
cases, we may say broadly that the wheel of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>life makes its full circle in passing from inorganic
matter through plants to animals and thence back to
gases and minerals again. The process of taking in
fresh matter, transforming it chemically into living
tissue, and thus repairing the waste occasioned by
the decomposition of the carbon-compounds of that
tissue, is technically known as Metabolism. This
is the typical and characteristic function of organic
life.</p>

<p>Now this function of living matter, or Protoplasm,
depends upon two elements: first, its Substance;
secondly, its Structure. As regards the former, we
are in this serious difficulty, that living matter can
never be chemically investigated by any means at
present known, for it dies immediately in presence of
any of the reagents which are used to ascertain its
chemical composition. It is known that there are
no <i>elementary</i> substances in living matter which are
not also found in the world of inorganic matter, but
it is also known that their synthetic combination in
living is different from that which obtains in dead
tissue,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> and it is precisely through this factor—that
of the grouping or synthesis of elements—that the
most remarkable forms of energy are developed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>The secret of life, therefore, cannot be stated in
terms of chemistry, because we cannot surprise the
secret of its chemical synthesis. Even if we could
do this we should still be unable to say why certain
syntheses should appear in living matter and resolve
themselves into others at death.</p>

<p>We find, however, in the investigation of organic
tissue (plant or animal) by such means as are available,
that one substance is common to all the organic
and is never found (as such) in the inorganic world.
This is called Proteid. It is composed of five elements—Carbon,
Hydrogen, Sulphur, Nitrogen, and
Oxygen, which are combined in proportions not at
present ascertained. Subject to the limitations just
set forth we may say that proteid is the essential
stuff of organic tissue. The two other usual (though
not, like proteid, universal) constituents of this tissue—the
Carbohydrates (sugar, starch, etc.) and the
Fats—are, it is believed, formed partly from the products
of the metabolism of proteid.</p>

<p>When we come to deal with the essential Structure
of life we are in much the same difficulty as that
in which we found ourselves in investigating its
chemical Substance. We can observe living cells
under the microscope, but the most powerful micro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>scope
has never reached the limits beyond which we
can say that there is no structure. There is another
limitation too. The microscope has revealed the
fact that all living tissue is made up of cells, but the
internal structure of the cell, beyond the fact that
it is composed of a fluid substance within which a
darker coloured nucleus is usually embedded, could
not be ascertained until the recent device of staining
the object with aniline dyes had been thought of.
Different substances in the cell are found to take
these dyes differently, and thus a world of structure
of the most singular kind has been revealed in
what formerly seemed a simple, semi-transparent
fluid. Some parts of this structure hover, as it were,
upon the very edge of perceptibility, the most suitable
dyes for bringing them under observation not
having been as yet discovered. There may be
others which no dye can reveal, but which are yet
active and necessary parts of the organism. Moreover,
here too the cell is killed by the means taken
to observe it, and the processes in which its structure
is engaged can only as a rule be deduced from
the observation of a great number of cells in which
their internal movements are arrested at different
stages of completion.</p>

<p>It has been practically demonstrated that all
organic life must be at least duplex if not multiplex
in its constituent elements. In its simplest known
form it consists of Protoplasm and Nucleus. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
know that the carrying-on of all vital functions
depends on peculiar relations existing between these
two elements, but what these relations exactly are
is still quite obscure. Both protoplasm and nucleus
are compounds of proteid with other chemical substances
not yet fully determined. Protoplasm is a
fluid, and has been shown by the epoch-making
observations of Bütschli<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> to have a structure resembling
that of an exceedingly minute foam. The
nucleus usually exists in the form of a single
definite body, but it may be scattered through the
protoplasm of the organism in little granules. In
the lowliest of organisms, the <i>Amœbæ</i>, we have
simply a speck of protoplasm containing a nucleus,
but with no surrounding wall of the harder substance
which protoplasm builds up for itself in the cells
belonging to higher forms of life. Such amœboid
forms are the white corpuscles in the human blood,
whose slow changes of form we can observe under
the microscope, and which play so important a part
in our economy by feeding on the noxious bacteria
which produce the various forms of blood-poisoning
and zymotic disease.</p>

<p>A more detailed account of the functions and
structure of the cell must be reserved for the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>chapter. In considering these and all other phenomena
of vitality let me again recall the warning
expressed in the taunt of Mephistopheles to the
young student: the lines are as true to-day as they
were when Goethe wrote them over a hundred years
ago:—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>There are two functions of organic life which
are often confused together, but which it is
well to keep distinct in our thought. These are
Growth and Development. The mark of growth is
that an organism, by assimilation from the outside
world, becomes <i>larger than it was</i>. But in development
it becomes <i>different from what it was</i>. The history of
an embryo in the womb presents a succession of phenomena
which, when one comes to realize them, almost
stagger thought; for, while remaining the <i>same
thing</i> all through, it is continually becoming a <i>different
class of thing</i>—first two cells, then one cell, then a
fish, a quadruped, ultimately a human being. This
is Development. Once born, it is laid hold of by
the principle of Growth which lasts until maturity.
Now in the groups called Species, as well as in
individuals, we observe exactly the same distinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
The members of a species multiply and increase
their numbers. This is Growth. But under certain
conditions, which we have now to investigate, they
vary in type and ultimately give rise to new species
differing widely from that from which they sprang.
This we call Development or, in the more popular
term for the process when applied to species,
Evolution.</p>

<p>The investigation of this process in all its details
has been the master-impulse of biology ever since
the fact of the process was established by the researches
of Darwin.</p>

<p>In Darwin’s time the study of evolution was
mainly an affair of what is called Natural History
But it has now been realized that fully to comprehend
the processes involved—so far as they can ever be
comprehended—it is necessary to find out of what
kind of material living beings are composed, and
how their fundamental processes take place. “The
ultimate problems of sex, fertilization, inheritance,
and development,” says Wilson, have been now
“shown to be <i>cell-problems</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Before going further,
therefore, we must give some account of the leading
facts connected with the structure and vital action of
the cell.</p>

<p class="tb">Since the publication of the Origin of Species,
probably the most important contribution to bio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>logical
theory is to be found in the researches of
Dr. A. Weismann, and particularly in his large work,
<span class="smcap">The Evolution Theory</span>, of which a masterly English
translation has recently appeared.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Weismann, on
one side, represents an heroic attempt to bring back
to the strictly mechanical principles of Darwinism
the tide of biological speculation, which has been
flowing more and more in the direction of recognizing
an essential and not a merely fortuitous connexion
between the goal of the evolution of natural
forms and the means taken by nature to attain it.
On another side he has brought the physiology of
the cell into true relation with the natural history of
the organism and of the species, and has become the
author, or at least the first great expounder and systematizer,
of a theory of heredity—the now famous
Germ-Plasm theory—much of which seems a solid,
permanent, and deeply important contribution to
knowledge. But this theory seems to lead straight
to a non-mechanical or psychic conception of the
driving-force of evolution, and Weismann has therefore
supplied the other part which, in the view of the
present writer and of many others better qualified to
judge, seems to be of the nature of a baseless and
improbable hypothesis, devised to find a means of
avoiding recourse to any non-mechanical conception
of the ultimate nature of evolutionary processes.</p>

<p>As we shall be much concerned with Weismann’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>views, let us place at the head of our study of them
a couple of passages in which his general attitude
towards the phenomena of vital processes is expressed.</p>

<p>“In our time,” he writes, “the great riddle has been
solved—the riddle of the origin of what is best suited
to its purpose without the co-operation of purposive
forces.”<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> “We must certainly assume,” he declares,
“that the mechanical theory of life is correct.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>A longer passage shows us what he understands by
‘mechanical’:—</p>

<p class="quot">“The living machine differs essentially from other
machines in the fact that it constructs itself; it arises by
development from a cell, by going through numerous
stages of development, but none of these stages is a dead
thing, each in itself is a living organism whose chief function
is to give rise to the next stage. Thus each stage of
the development may be compared to a machine whose
function consists in producing a similar but more complex
machine. Each stage is thus composed, just like the
complete organism, of a number of such ‘constellations’
of elementary substances and elementary forces, whose
number in the beginnings is relatively small, but increases
rapidly with each new stage.”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>It would have been simpler, but it would not have
suited Weismann’s conception of nature, to say that
the “living machine” differs essentially from other
machines in not being a machine at all, or anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>in the least like one. No machine constructs itself.
No machine can do anything but repeat a certain
series of movements, each series exactly similar to
the last. What Weismann has described is <i>not</i> a
machine, just because it is a living organism. It is
surely as true in biology as it is in mechanics that
in any purely physical chain of sequences you
cannot by any possibility get more out at the end
than you put in at the beginning, unless you take it
in upon the way.</p>

<p>“Development,” writes Weismann, “is an expression
of life.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> But “life,” again, is merely “a chemico-physical
phenomenon.”<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> To say that development is
an expression of a chemico-physical phenomenon does
not seem a very illuminating or helpful generalization.
The fact is that the statement that life is a chemico-physical
phenomenon does not take us further
towards an understanding of the subject than when
we say, what is equally true, that chemical and
physical phenomena are a manifestation of life.
Life is everywhere. We use it as a convenient term
for the energies associated with ‘living’ protoplasm,
because we observe that when it is present protoplasmic
structures act and react (as in the phenomena
of nutrition, for instance) in certain chemico-physical
ways, while, if it be absent, the same protoplasm acts
in other ways, also chemico-physical, but quite different
from the former, and analogous to the ways of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>minerals and of gases into which dead protoplasm
finally resolves itself. The chemico-physical actions
and reactions appear in a living plant or animal
to be under the direction of a force devoted to
the preservation of that particular organism. The
smallest atom of organic life includes not only a
chemical compound but a chemist. In the mineral
world we may say broadly that there is no individuality
of parts.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> With protoplasmic structure,
therefore, a stage is reached in the evolution of life
which we may rightfully call ‘life’ <i>par excellence</i>, but
there has been no breach of continuity, and it is highly
probable, as Weismann himself suggests, that far below
the limits of microscopic observation the transformation
of ‘dead’ into ‘living’ matter is continually
going forward. When, therefore, we speak of the
action of living protoplasm the distinction is rather
between this action and that of a piece of mechanism
than between protoplasm and minerals or gases.</p>

<p>The phenomena of cell-growth, reproduction, and
heredity are those which lie at the basis of all
organized protoplasmic life, and in all the forms
of that life, vegetable as well as animal, they are
extraordinarily similar; there is, in fact, nothing
which all the species of living things have so much
in common. One of the most wonderful and fascinating
chapters in the whole range of science is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>that which contains the account of these processes,
and it is only within the last few years that it has
been possible to write it. Weismann, in a certain
section of his <span class="smcap">Evolution Theory</span>, has brought the
facts together in a manner which, for its lucidity and
mastery of the subject-matter, deserves to be called
a classic example of scientific exposition.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> To understand
the basis of the higher manifestations of life, these
processes, as we have said, must first be understood,
and an account of them, based on Weismann, and
accepting his germ-plasm theory so far as it seems to
accord with established facts, will be given, of course
only in the broadest outlines.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> At the same time
it will be attempted, here and there, to throw some
light on the <i>rationale</i> of the processes described.</p>

<p class="tb">All animal and vegetable structure arises from
cellular tissue, and in fact <i>is</i> either cellular tissue
or, as in the case of bones, scales, etc., the mineral
deposit formed by the action of cells. The simplest
living forms are composed of single cells, and the
most complex and huge of them were each once
nothing more than a single cell, possessed of the
powers of development and growth. In multi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>cellular
organisms, this single originating cell is
usually formed by the fusion of two imperfect cells
by what is indifferently called conjugation, sexual
reproduction, or ‘amphimixis.’ All cells, whether
they are the product of conjugation or not, grow,
when they do grow, fundamentally in the same way,
and this way must now be described.</p>

<p>The contents of the typical cell are broadly
differentiated into (1) a more or less hardened envelope
containing (2) a substance called cytoplasm (Gk.
κύτος, a cell), and (3) a small, rounded, dark-coloured
body called the nucleus. Until recently nothing
more than this was known of the structure of the
cell, and nothing at all of the functions of the nucleus.
Now, keener microscopic research and better instruments
have thrown a flood of light on cell-organization,
and the nucleus is revealed as a powerful factor
in the vital processes of the cell and the bearer of
its hereditary substance<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>—that which makes it a cell
of some particular organism, plant or animal, and
of no other. This hereditary substance, divined by the
botanist Nägeli, and since observed by Weismann and
others, is called ‘chromatin’ (from the fact that it is
observed by means of the stain it takes from the
addition of an aniline dye), or ‘idioplasm’ (Nägeli’s
appellation), which might be rendered the ‘selfhood
substance’ of the cell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<p>Cellular structure begins, as has long been known,
by the division of a cell into two, each of the parts
then proceeding to grow by the assimilative power
of protoplasm and in due time to divide in its turn.
A mass of these cells is called ‘cellular tissue.’ The
so-called ‘budding’ of a small cell from the side of
the parent is, of course, simply a form of division.
The process of division and redivision goes on, accompanied
by a differentiation in the shape and
function of the different cells or groups of cells
which are formed, until the structure of the plant
or animal is completed. In these operations the
nucleus plays the principal part. The division of
the cell is essentially the division of the nucleus.
A detached portion of a cell which contains nothing
of the nucleus can reproduce itself no more; it
perishes.</p>

<p class="quot">This illustration, which (by permission of The Macmillan Co.) I take
from Wilson’s work, <span class="smcap">The Cell</span>, is one of remarkable interest, for in
it the microscope has caught, in a piece of actual tissue from the skin
of the salamander, <i>Amblystoma</i>, three nuclei in different stages of
mitotic division. Most of the nuclei, which are seen as large, roundish
objects in their respective cells, show the chromatin in its ‘resting’ condition
interspersed through the nucleus. The nucleus under <i>a</i> shows
the chromatin gathered into chromosomes. At <i>b</i> the centrosomes with
their astral figures (which can barely be detected) have been formed,
the chromosomes have carried out their longitudinal division, and are
being attracted half towards one centrosome and half towards the
other. A little above this the process has been carried further, and
the sides of the cell are beginning to contract, preparatory to forming
two new ones. In Fig. 2 will be found a clear representation of the
astral figures.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p></div>

<p>The above illustration from Wilson’s <span class="smcap">The Cell</span> shows in more or
less diagrammatic form the stage of nuclear division in which the
chromosomes, as yet undivided, have arranged themselves in the centre
of the nucleus. The centrosomes with their astral figures have been
formed, and have taken their places near each pole of the nucleus.
The next stage is represented at <i>b</i> in Fig. 1.</p>

<p>When a cell is about to divide, an organ of recent
discovery, termed the ‘centrosome,’ comes into play.
This appears as the core of a sort of rayed or star-like
figure, and it takes up its position beside the nucleus.
When the cell is resting, the chromatin is dispersed
through the nucleus in a mass of broken lines, forming
a kind of network. When division begins, this broken-up
substance forms itself into a series of small threads,
sometimes straight, sometimes looped or curved.
These are called ‘chromosomes.’ There are always
a definite and invariable number of chromosomes for
every species of plant or animal—the cell of a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>has so many,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> of a grasshopper so many, of a lily
so many. The chromosomes range themselves in a
belt across the centre of the nucleus, and the centrosome
breaks into two parts, which take up a position
one at each end of the nucleus. Regarding the
nucleus as a tiny globe, we may say that the chromo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>somes
lie in the equatorial plane, while the two parts
of the centrosome move towards the North and South
Poles respectively.</p>

<p>The centrosomes, at the two poles of the nucleus, are
surrounded each with a halo of ray-like processes (the
centrosphere), and on the sides next each other these
rays penetrate the nucleus and join, forming a spindle-shaped
figure with a centrosphere at each end. This
spindle figure appears to be the organ by which the
division is accomplished, for each of the chromosomes
now splits itself in two longitudinally, as one
cleaves a log of wood, and one half passes over to
each centrosphere, thus making an exact division of
the whole chromatin or hereditary substance. An
indentation now appears in the outer wall of the
cell and also in the nucleus—it deepens and deepens,
and finally two cells appear instead of one, each with
a nucleus, a centrosome, and a supply of chromatin,
the latter now breaking up into its original condition
of diffusion through the nucleus. In multicellular
organisms the two new cells, of course, do not separate,
but a wall is formed between them. Some plant-cells
contain several nuclei; in this case division of the
nucleus is not necessarily followed by that of the cell.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<p>Throughout the processes of cell division it is apparent
that the utmost care is taken to ensure an exact
partition of the chromatin between the two new cells.
This partition has to be qualitative as well as quantitative;
for one chromosome may, and no doubt does,
differ in function and influence from another, and has
various elements within itself. The <i>longitudinal</i> division
of each chromosome, in which the elements are
arranged like beads on a rosary, ensures that the
different elements of the whole hereditary substance
shall appear in each new cell in exactly the same
relative proportion as in the parent cell; just as if
two persons had to divide between them a dozen
apples of different varieties, and secured perfect
equality, not by taking six apples each, but by dividing
every apple in two. <i>This is the fundamental cause
of the fixity of species</i>, which means the production
of offspring having the same specific characteristics
as their parents. How, under these conditions, the
<i>mutability</i> of species is brought about must be discussed
later. It is first of all necessary to inquire
more closely into the composition of the chromatin,
and to study the special phenomena of cell-growth
in connexion with conjugation, where new and extraordinary
features come to light.</p>

<p class="tb">A chromosome is not, or is not usually, a simple
body. In all but the very lowest organisms it is
composed, as we have said, of a number of elements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Each of these elements is styled a ‘determinant,’
and it controls the form, colour, and function of some
definite part of the future plant or animal. Weismann
believes the determinants to be grouped into complex
bodies called ‘ids,’ each id containing all the
determinants necessary for a whole being, and each
chromosome being composed of a number of ids.
These ids are microscopically visible; they form
the beads on the rosary already referred to; but
their exact composition and potency are largely
conjectural at present. How far the subdivision of
determinants may go, it is, of course, impossible to ascertain.
We cannot say, for instance, whether there
is a determinant for every hair of the head, or one for
the hirsute covering in general, or one for each of the
different sections of the scalp. But the division is
very minute. Each of the ids may be a very complex
body, as we see by the manner in which, in
some families, small physical signs like a patch of
hair differing from the colour of the rest, or a tiny
pit or mole on the skin of a certain part of the body,
may be handed down, in that precise position, for
generations. There may be, and, in fact, in the
higher plants and animals there <i>must</i> be, a number
of determinants for each part of the structure, and
the final characteristics of that part must be the resultant
of a blend of all these determinants, the
more powerful predominating in proportion to their
vitality and force. The whole body of the chromo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>somes
may therefore be said to represent one or
more complete beings in diagrammatic form, each
part of the complete animal or plant being represented
by some part of a chromosome, though of
course not physically resembling it. And we thus
strike on the very curious and startling fact that, as
far as we can see, <i>every</i> cell in every organism
throughout the world of life contains all the elements
of the whole being to which it belongs, and
is, potentially, that being.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> All the higher organisms
possess two kinds of cells—reproductive cells which
have the faculty of fusing together to reproduce their
kind, and ‘somatic’ or body cells, which, although
they all originate in a reproductive cell, multiply
only by division, and have the function of forming
the various parts of the bodily structure. Of the
nucleus of a germ cell “we cannot say that it
differs in any essential or definite way from the
nucleus of any other cell.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> All possess the chromatin
or hereditary substance of the organism,
though, according to Boveri, the germ cells alone
receive <i>all</i> the chromatin of the parent cell, the
derived somatic cells having to part with some of
it.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> There may be some distinction, though on what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>it may be based it is at present impossible to say,
between cells that are capable of developing into
a complete organized creature and those that are
not.</p>

<p>Every somatic cell is doomed to perish, but every
reproductive cell now upon the globe is united, not
metaphorically, not by a chain of successive originations
or impulses, but by actual identity of substance,
with the first beginnings of protoplasmic life in the
abyss of time; and it has before it a potential immortality
commensurate with life itself. It is not, as
used to be thought, a physiological product of the
organism in which it dwells; it is a part of the
original reproductive cell from which that organism
sprang.</p>

<p>To understand these conceptions we must now
study the phenomena of reproduction in the light of
recent discoveries.</p>

<p class="tb">The lowest form of the reproductive process is,
of course, by simple division and redivision. This
is characteristic of many of those organisms which
consist only of a single cell, and it may co-exist,
even in these, with a considerable degree of structural
complexity, as in the ‘trumpet animalcule,’ <i>Stentor
raselii</i>. But among the lowest of these unicellular
organisms a curious process is sometimes observed
to take place, in which we may doubtless recognize
the origin of sexual reproduction. Two, three, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
more <i>Amœbæ</i><a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> approach each other, partially coalesce,
and remain united for some time. They then separate
again. No new creatures are formed by this
contact; there are no visible results at all. But that
<i>something</i> which is for the advantage of the organisms
takes place during this period of union is certain, and in
the light of what is known of processes in other organisms
we can make a very good guess at what this something
is. Each <i>Amœba</i> parts with some of its chromatin
to some other and receives an equivalent in
exchange. The creature is thus reconstituted. The
element of <i>change</i>, which always provides so marked
a stimulus to vital processes, has been obtained. The
process has actually been observed in a certain Infusorian,
<i>Noctiluca</i>. Two <i>Noctilucas</i> coalesce, and
then proceed to divide <i>at right angles to the plane of
contact</i>. This necessarily has the effect of giving to
each of the two new <i>Noctilucas</i> which result from the
division half the nucleus and chromatin of one
parent and half of the other. There is, however, no
actual new birth or multiplication of beings; there
are only two <i>Noctilucas</i> as before.</p>

<p>We can now imagine that if a certain class of
unicellular organisms are in the habit of approaching
each other for the purpose of this interchange of
portions of their chromatin, they might occasionally,
under the influence of the approaching conjugation,
expel those portions of chromatin <i>before</i> another cell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>was in a position to receive it. What would happen
if two cells, each of which had thus got rid of half
its chromatin, were to come into contact? Plainly,
they would fuse together; they would not separate
again; they would become a new organism. Each
would have supplied just what the other lacked.</p>

<p>This process, forming the bridge from mere cell
division to sexual reproduction, is a hypothetical one;
it has not, I believe, been actually observed in unicellular
organisms, but it is exactly what we find to
be taking place when we reach the stage of sexual
reproduction among multicellulars. Multicellular
organisms of more or less elaborate structure plainly
cannot, without breaking up, fuse together like single
cells. How, then, are they, as a species, to gain
the advantages of the temporary union and interchange
of elements which we have observed in the
low unicellular organisms? Only in one way—by
producing special cells for this purpose. These cells
must represent the whole parent, they must be
capable of shedding half their chromatin, and, when
they have fused, must be capable of growing into a
complete organism like the parent. When these
specialized cells have been formed, the others, the
somatic cells, will at the same time have been specialized
for other functions, and will thus naturally lose
the original capacity for interchanging chromatin with
other cells, <i>i.e.</i> for conjugation. We see the significance,
then, of Weismann’s remark, “germ cells made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
appearance along with the multicellular body.”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> They
are an instance of that differentiation of structure
and function which takes place in all highly organized
life. We must note also that the benefits of
conjugation which are realized <i>individually</i> by the
lowest unicellular forms are only realized <i>as a species</i>
by the multicellulars. A species must, then, be
regarded as in some sense an organic whole, and
not as a mere aggregate of individuals.</p>

<p>In some very curious cases which stand on the
borderland between sexual and non-sexual reproduction,
the same organism is capable of employing both
methods. Thus, among the lower seaweeds (<i>Algæ</i>),
the genus <i>Pandorina</i> consists of a colony of sixteen
green cells contained in a kind of gelatinous matrix
which the cells excrete. Each cell is ordinarily capable
of recreating the whole organism by division.
But after this process has gone on for some time, the
need of conjugation is felt, the colony breaks up and
cells begin to fuse with each other, though never with
those of the same colony. In <i>Pandorina</i> the two
conjugating cells are similar in appearance, but in
the genus <i>Volvox</i> we begin to see a difference in the
appearance of the two kinds of conjugating cells.
What may be called the ‘female’ cells (germ cells)
are large and quiescent; the ‘male’ (sperm cells)
are smaller and active. The primary meaning of
this is that the larger cells have stored up a supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>of nutriment for the young organism, and are therefore
bulkier and less active, while the others contain
only the bare elements of cell-structure and are
therefore able, as they are obliged, to be active in order
to search out their quiescent mates. A strictly vegetable
organism, in this stage, may therefore possess
organs of locomotion, and be as free-moving as a
fish. A remarkable fact has come to light respecting
those organisms (like some <i>Algæ</i> among vegetables
and Infusorians among animals), which are capable
both of conjugation and of reproduction by division,
namely, that the supply of nutriment often determines
which method shall be followed. If nutriment
is abundant, division is practised; if it becomes
scanty, an impulse appears to be given to conjugation.
Infusorians, which ordinarily conjugate at
pretty regular intervals, can be kept indefinitely
from doing so, and confined to division, by the
simple process of supplying abundance of nutritive
matter in the water in which they live.</p>

<p class="quot">“As far as we can see from an a priori point of view,”
writes Dr. E. B. Wilson in his great work on cell structure
and cell phenomena, “there is no reason why, barring
accident, cell-division should not follow cell-division in
endless succession in the stream of life. It is possible,
indeed probable, that such may be the fact in some of the
lower and simpler forms of life where no form of sexual
reproduction is known to occur. In the vast majority of
living forms, however, the series of cell-divisions tends to
run in cycles in each of which the energy of division
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>gradually comes to an end and is only restored by an
admixture of living matter derived from another cell.
This operation, known as fertilization, or fecundation, is
the essence of sexual reproduction, and in it we behold
a process by which, on the one hand, the energy of division
is restored, and by which, on the other hand, two independent
lines of descent are blended into one. Why
this dual process should take place we are as yet unable to
say.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>The actual mechanism of sexual reproduction is
essentially the same wherever it occurs, whether in
a seaweed or a human being. Two cells have to
play their part in it, the Germ cell and the Sperm
cell, and these, in the higher orders of organized
beings, come to be located respectively in distinct
classes or sexes of individuals. Reproduction begins
by the fusion of a sperm, or male cell with a germ,
or female cell.</p>

<p>These cells originally resemble the other cells of
the same species, containing the same number of
chromosomes. If this number was, say, sixteen,
which is believed to be the number in man, then
a fusion of two complete cells, if it were possible,
would produce a cell with thirty-two chromosomes,
and that would mean a different species of animal.
What happens is that each of the reproductive cells,
male and female, prepares itself for conjugation by
getting rid of half its chromosomes. Two divisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>of the nucleus take place, <i>not</i> as in the ordinary
fashion of cell-division, when the chromosomes split
longitudinally, but in such a way that, in each
division, four of the sixteen chromosomes are bodily
expelled from the nucleus and from the cell, when
they either perish or, in some cases, appear to help
in forming an envelope of nutritive matter round the
germ cell. These divisions are called ‘maturation
divisions,’ and until they are accomplished, fecundation
is impossible. When a sperm cell after maturation
comes into the neighbourhood of a germ
cell, it penetrates into its substance, using the long
<i>flagellum</i>, or tail-like process, with which it is
equipped as an organ of locomotion. The two
nuclei come into contact and coalesce, and we have
thus a new cell with its sixteen chromosomes complete.
This cell is the origin of the new being. It
divides in two, and each part divides and redivides,
different cells gradually differentiating themselves as
muscular tissue, cartilage, blood-corpuscles, nerves,
reproductive cells, and so forth, until the whole
animal is built up and is ready for birth. One point
of cardinal importance must here be noted. The
originating cell, as we have seen, has eight of its
sixteen chromosomes from one parent and eight
from another. When division takes place, these
chromosomes, as we have seen, split longitudinally,
and the result is that each new cell gets exactly the
same mixture of chromatin as that of the originating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
cell—half from each parent. This principle of
division is carried on throughout the whole process
of building up the new being—every cell of the
latter, down to the minutest details of its structure,
containing an exactly equal quantity of hereditary
elements from each of its parents.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above account that the
old conception of the germ-cell as a passive body,
incapable of a change till ‘fertilized’ by a male or
sperm cell, was altogether wrong. Both male and
female cells prepare themselves for conjugation long
before it takes place, and neither of them can be
said to be a more active agent in fertilization than
the other. Not ‘fertilization’ but ‘fusion’ is the keyword
of the process. The mystical conception, as
old as Plato, of the male and female as representing
respectively the two halves of a complete being,
turns out to be no poetic metaphor. As regards
the essential features of reproduction, it is a literal
fact.</p>

<p>If we now ask why and by what mysterious law
all these exact and elaborate choric movements take
place Weismann and his school refer us to “chemotactic
forces,” the nature of which is yet unknown.
Chemotaxis means simply the effect of the <i>presence</i>
of certain substances on vital organisms without
specific chemical action. The really essential fact
is that these special chemotactic forces are working
<i>in living protoplasm</i>. Life is not the product or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
slave of any chemotactic forces, but their maker and
steersman.</p>

<p>The following passage from a work of the late
Prof. Geo. Rolleston may be pertinently quoted here:—</p>

<p class="quot">“There exists, as is well known, a tendency to resolve
all physiological into physico-chemical phenomena: undoubtedly
many have been, and some more may still
remain to be, so resolved; but the public may rest assured
that in the kingdom of Biology no desire for a rectification
of frontiers will ever be called out by any such attempts at,
or successes in the way of, encroachment; and that where
physics and chemistry can show that physico-chemical
agencies are sufficient to account for the phenomena, there
their claim upon the territory will be acceded to, as in the
cases we have been glancing at [certain animal poisons],
and where such claims cannot be established and fail to
come up to the quantitative requirements of strict science,
as in the cases of continuous and of discontinuous development
or self-multiplication of a contagious germ, and in
some others, they will be disallowed.”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>This was written in 1870. A generation later
the attempt to reduce life to a physico-chemical
phenomenon had not made much way, as may be
judged by the following passage from Strasburger’s
<span class="smcap">Text Book of Botany</span>:—<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p class="quot">“Vital phenomena are essentially bound up with the
living protoplasm. No other substance exhibits a similar
series of remarkable and varied phenomena, such as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>may compare with the attributes of life. As both physics
and chemistry have been restricted to the investigation of
lifeless bodies, any attempt to explain vital phenomena
solely by chemical and physical laws could only be induced
by a false conception of their real significance, and must
lead to fruitless results. The physical attributes of air,
water, and of the glasses and metals made use of in
physical apparatus, can never explain qualities like nutrition,
respiration, growth, irritability and reproduction.”</p>

<p>And Wilson concludes his work by the admission
that</p>

<p class="quot">“the study of the cell has on the whole seemed to widen
rather than to narrow the enormous gap that separates
even the lowest forms of life from the inorganic world.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>“The lowest <i>observed</i> forms of life” would have
been a more exact way of stating the fact.</p>

<p class="tb">Many questions of detail will occur to the reader at
this point, which he will find answered in the pages
of Weismann or other investigators. Here we must
confine ourselves to what has a distinct bearing on
the objects of this study. One of the points which
may be briefly touched on is the question how it
comes that two germ cells, once having passed
through their maturation divisions, cannot fuse and
form a new being; nor can two sperm cells. Were
this possible we might have ‘self-fertilization,’ and
virginal conception or parthenogenesis, whenever two
germ cells in the ovary of a female animal or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>in that of a plant happened to come into contact.
But since the object of fusion is the union of (more
or less) <i>unlike</i>, and not closely related, elements, we
find that even when a kind of self-fertilization occurs,
as in some plants, the sperm or pollen cells are differentiated
visibly, and probably still more invisibly,
from the germ cells. But, apart from this, the
object of preventing the union of reproductive cells
of the same sex is mechanically attained by a very
curious device. The cell-organ by which division
is carried out is the centrosome. But in the course
of the two maturation divisions of the germ cell,
that cell <i>loses its centrosome</i>, which seems to be
absorbed into the protoplasmic substance of the cell
when once its task is accomplished. No fusion of
any number of such cells can therefore lead to any
further change or growth, for growth is based on cell
division, and the centrosome is the organ of division.
The sperm cell, on the other hand, does not lose
its centrosome; it retains it to form the organ
of division for the new cell after conjugation. But,
reduced as it is to little more than a bare nucleus
without any envelope of nutritive matter, the sperm
cell cannot support the intense vital activity called
for in the initial stages of the life of a new being, and
therefore sperm cells, like the germ cells, though for
a different reason, would be incapable of mutual conjugation,
even if the element of mutual attraction
existed among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Another point of interest is the question of the determination
of sex. The known facts afford a strong
corroboration of the general theory of reproduction
outlined above. It has not been ascertained, nor is it,
perhaps, ascertainable, whether the sperm cells of the
male contain in their chromatin a preponderance of
male, while the germ cells provide chiefly the female
determinants.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> However this may be, it is certain
that determinants which severally control the formation
both of male and of female structure are <i>always</i>
present in every combination of the sperm and
germ cells, those which exhibit the greatest energy
and vitality probably prevailing in the determination
of the sex of the future being. This accounts at
once not only for the cases (rare in the higher
animals) of actual hermaphroditism, when the sex is
really indistinguishable, but for the universal occurrence
in all male animals of rudimentary female
organs (such as mammæ) and in all females of rudimentary
male organs. Both sets of determinants are
always present; the more powerful prevail, but the
weaker have a deflecting influence on the total result.
When the primary sexual characters of the embryo
are determined, they appear to communicate a stimulus
which starts into activity the appropriate secondary
characters, such as colouring and other modifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>not directly sexual. An extraordinary case, which
I take from Beddard’s <span class="smcap">Animal Coloration</span>,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> is that
of a chaffinch which was found to have on the left
side of its body the plumage of a hen bird and
on its right that of a cock. On dissection the meaning
of this freak of physiology was revealed. The
bird was an hermaphrodite, having the female organs
of generation on the left side of its body and the
male on the right. Hermaphroditism is not in itself
a very uncommon phenomenon in birds (though here
it is a monstrosity, not, as in slugs and snails, a
natural and useful condition); but the way in which
in this instance it governed the distribution of colour
is most peculiar; and of course it strongly reinforces
Weismann’s conception of distinct determinants for
the various details of bodily structure.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>This brings us to the recognition of a <i>competition
among determinants</i> which is an important, indeed a
cardinal, feature in Weismann’s theory of evolution.
He makes, as I am forced to believe, an illegitimate
and extravagant use of it, but the principle may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>really exist and be operative without furnishing the
master-word to the riddle of organized being. The
master-word, as I shall try to show, is nature’s will
to live. But before going fully into this argument,
let us fix in our minds the <i>rationale</i> of those processes
of elementary organic life which have been described
in this chapter. Protoplasmic life may be
supposed to have originated, and perhaps to be still
originating, in certain molecular combinations of
matter. In other words, the combination, when it
took place, developed certain peculiar forces through
which it was enabled to maintain itself and to grow,
by the processes called assimilation and nutrition.
These forces, then, were potentially present in
nature before the molecules combined to evoke
them. They are among the latent powers of life.
They waited, ready to be called into action when the
required external form should be arrived at in the
play of molecular energy. Life first originated, no
doubt, in unconnected and inconceivably small units
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>of protoplasm. Between the units thus formed and
their combination into the elaborate structure which
we now know a cell to be—packed as full of varied
energies, it has been said, as an ironclad is of
machinery—there is evidently a very wide gap. All
we know is that when we have got the cell, we find it
in possession of a complex apparatus for subdivision,
which, taken together with the faculties of nutrition
and growth, enable any one cell to multiply indefinitely
by producing replicas of itself. To <i>life</i> and
<i>growth</i>, then, has been added the faculty for <i>multiplication</i>.
Here we strike on a veritable mystery.
Why should any new movement ever take place?
Why should a cell ever divide in two? We can only
say that it is its property to do so.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> It does so because
it is alive. Did this property first arise as one
of a multitude of aimless movements—the only one
which ensured permanence and multiplicity to the
organisms which exhibited it? If so, then Nature,
at the time when life began on the earth, behaved in
a manner most unlike that in which she behaves at
present. If we are to interpret the processes hidden
in the remote past by the light of what we see at
present, we shall conclude that, at bottom, the will to
live made molecular action—and the same force in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>corporated
itself in the combinations which originated
protoplasmic life, ordered the structure of the cell,
and gave it the need and the power to multiply.
Nature is for ever changing, for ever straining after
new life, after more life.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the cell with its powers of
division, the next step was the power of conjugation
between cells with their interchange of vital
substance, bringing about, in Weismann’s words, “a
wealth and diversity of organic architecture which
without it would have been unattainable.” It takes
place by means of physical energies, but the process
is entirely inexplicable unless we assume that it exists
to satisfy a need, a <i>Drang</i>, for life. And this need,
although of course it displays itself in physical
processes, is not in itself a physical process. At
the very beginnings of structural life, if not
before it, we are obliged to pass beyond physics
in order to comprehend physical phenomena. Whenever
we find an aggregate of living units, such as a
<i>Pandorina</i> colony, living with a communal life which
is other than the sum-total of the lives of the individual
units, we are in presence at once of the
necessity for a metaphysical conception, to render intelligible
the unity in diversity which we perceive.</p>

<p>The response of living protoplasm to the stimuli
it receives from the outside world is normally directed
to the maintenance of the life and form of the
organism. The response of what is called ‘lifeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>’
matter is of another nature; not because it is really
lifeless, for if it were it would not respond at all, but
because it has no organisms to protect and foster.
We all know the nature of the action of gravity on
Newton’s apple. It was treated as a dead substance,
like a stone, and gravity acted upon it as upon all
other ponderable matter. But when it had fallen to
the earth, had decayed, and one of its pips began to
grow, the action of gravity began to be manifested
in a quite different and very peculiar fashion. It
has been ascertained by a series of ingenious experiments
that gravity is the force which obliges the
roots of a plant to sink downwards into the earth.
This does not, of course, mean that the roots are
drawn downwards by attraction of the earth, but
that the pull of gravitation gives a certain stimulus
to the cells concerned which makes them grow in
that direction. Precisely the same stimulus communicated
to the cells of the stem has the very
opposite effect—these it causes to grow upright into
the air and light. Thus the roots are, as it is termed,
positively, and the stems negatively, geotropic. The
substance of the root cells and of the stem cells is
the same, the stimulus is the same, but the effects on
growth agree in only one point, that they are respectively
what the plant requires them to be. There is
no doubt that if a species of plants were placed in
such a position that it would serve them for the
roots to grow upwards, then upward-growing roots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
would eventually be evolved; in fact, this is actually
the case in the lateral underground roots of
certain mangroves which rise to the surface and
become modified as breathing organs, and in the
aerial roots of various orchids, etc.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> When a change
of habitat takes place calling for new developments
of structure to meet new conditions, these developments
are not, as a matter of actual observation,
found to be mechanically ‘selected’ from a mass of
random movements and modifications of tissue—they
reach their goal, it is true, by a series of <i>gradual</i>
approximations, but the goal is in sight from the
beginning. In other words, <i>adaptability is a fundamental
character of life</i>. Hence the fact that multicellular
organisms which cannot, as a whole, fuse
with others, adapt themselves to these conditions by
the allotment of special cells for that purpose; while,
again, the production of multicellular organisms is
itself an adaptation to Nature’s need for the higher
organization of life.</p>

<p class="quot">“The botanist Reinke,” writes Weismann, “has recently
called attention once again to the fact that machines
cannot be directly made up of primary physico-chemical
forces or energies, but that, as Lotze said, forces of a
superior order are indispensable, which so dispose the
fundamental chemico-physical forces that they must act in
the way aimed at by the purpose of the machine....
Organisms also [according to Reinke] are machines which
perform a particular and purposeful kind of work, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>they are only capable of doing so because the energies
which perform the work are forced into definite paths by
superior forces; these superior forces are thus ‘the steersmen
of the energies.’”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Weismann admits that there is “undoubtedly a
kernel of truth in this view,” but he is content with this
perfunctory acknowledgment. His main efforts are
devoted to the substitution of fortuitously developed
“constellations” of molecular energy for any force
which can be deemed to have the slightest tincture of
intelligence or purpose. “In our time,” as he writes,
“the great riddle has been solved—the riddle of the
origin of what is best suited to its purpose without
the co-operation of purposive forces.” The nature
of the proposed solution can be best described and
discussed in another chapter, when we shall be in a
position to consider it in relation to the whole history
of organic development from its origin in protoplasmic
life to the evolution of species in plants and animals.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="indent">
THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION:
THE DARWIN-LAMARCK
EXPLANATION</p>

<p class="quot">“Quelle est donc cette nature sujette à être effacée? La coutume
est une seconde nature qui detruit la première. Pourquoi la
coutume n’est elle pas naturelle? J’ai bien peur que cette nature
ne soit elle-même qu’une première coutume, comme la coutume est
une seconde nature.”—<span class="smcap">Pascal.</span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>E now approach the <i>arcana</i> of Evolution. The
processes we have to deal with in this chapter
are not, and probably never will be, the subjects of
direct observation. All we can hope to do is to
generalize from the results which have risen to the
surface of life about the unseen forces from which
they spring. The problem is to find (if possible) a
generalization which will cover all the facts relating
to that modification of natural forms, habits, and
instincts which, when it reaches a certain point, means
the establishment of a new species. We know that
the thing happens, but we shall not understand <i>how</i>
it happens until either the mechanism of the process
is laid bare, or until it is clear that we are in presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of an agency not entirely definable in terms of
mechanical action.</p>

<p>The fixity of species is maintained by a number
of conditions, chief among which must be reckoned
the law of reproduction by conjugation, with the
consequent intermixture of numerous different lines
of descent. From one point of view conjugation, as
Weismann so often insists, greatly favours the adaptability
of the organism to new and varied conditions
of life, inasmuch as it results in the mingling together
in each individual of a great number of varied
determinants. But when the conditions are constant,
conjugation has also the obvious effect of constantly
reabsorbing, as it were, any heritable abnormalities
which may occur in individuals or the species,
and bringing them back to type. An individual
possessing some abnormality of structure will be
most unlikely to find a mate possessing the same
abnormality—the mate will be either an ordinary
individual or will possess, if any, some quite different
variation. Their descendants will, therefore, usually
show more resemblance to the normal type than to
the one abnormal parent, and in their descendants
again, for the same reason, the abnormal feature will
be still further reduced, until finally it disappears.
It is only by the careful selection of mates extending
over many generations that pigeon-fanciers, to take
one prominent instance, are able to establish a
new type. Left to mate uncontrolled among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>selves
we should never have had the great variety of
breeds which have been produced by the art of the
fancier from the original rock-pigeon. The small
variations which form the starting points of his
operations would, under natural conditions, have soon
been resolved into the normal type. What is it in
nature, then, that sometimes appears to play the part
of the intelligent breeder and to urge the plastic
forms of life into new moulds?</p>

<p class="tb">The goal of the breeder is some new form which
it pleases him to produce, either for its use, or its
beauty, or for its mere singularity. The goal of
nature, at least the apparent and immediate goal, is
the adaptation of each species to the circumstances
of its life. And the first thing that strikes the investigator
is the way, often indeed not perfect, but
usually most impressive in its apparent thoughtfulness
and care, in which the organs of plants and
animals are fashioned to secure the most favourable
results. But all this is the result of development.
The whale is a creature excellently adapted for its
present mode of life, but we know that it was once
a furry land animal with four legs; the legs are all
there still, in modified or rudimentary form, and the
fur appears at a certain stage of embryonic development.
When we ask, How did this extraordinary
transformation come about? what we really mean is,
How did the determinants composing the chromatin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in the reproductive cells of the original land animal
so come to alter as to produce the characteristics of
the whale? For new species can only be evolved by
means of structural modifications <i>capable of being
transmitted by inheritance</i>; and nothing can be inherited
except through the action of the determinants.
A modification which does not affect the reproductive
cells has no significance in the evolution of
species.</p>

<p>To this question Darwinism has given us our choice
of two answers, which may be termed respectively the
Darwin-Lamarck and the Darwin-Weismann theories.
Lamarck explained the origin of species by
the accumulated effect of the inheritance, through
many generations, of modifications acquired by the
exercise, or the disuse, of the modified organs.
Observing that living protoplasm responds to demands
upon it (thus, for instance, a muscle when
systematically exercised attracts more nourishment
from the blood and grows stronger, and callosities
form to protect the skin of the hands of a manual
worker), he assumed that modifications so acquired
might be transmitted by inheritance. Each new
generation, then, would start with a slightly better
equipment in this particular respect than the former
one had when it started; and so, by slow degrees, a
new organ, or one markedly differing from the
original form, might be built up. The world, since
protoplasmic life first appeared upon it, has gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
through many changes, and has always presented a
vast variety of climatic and other conditions, calling
for the most varied types of organic structure. As
animal life gradually spread over the earth and sea,
the effort to cope with the different conditions it met
with would gradually, by the combined action of
exercise, of disuse, and of heredity, produce multitudes
of different types; and these are what we
know as families, orders, genera, and species. When
a species is fairly well adapted to its surroundings
and way of life it may go on indefinitely without
change. But should any members of it be obliged
to migrate, from scarcity of food or any other reason,
to some new locality where somewhat different conditions
prevail, structural alterations would soon
begin to appear to suit those new conditions. Thus
the giraffe, if we could trace its ancestry back, would
probably be found to have originated in some animal
not differing from the vast majority of quadrupeds
in the relative proportions of its fore and hind quarters.
But some members of this original species—or
the whole species, owing to some change in their
surroundings—found themselves obliged to rely
largely for food on leaves growing at a considerable
height. They stretched up to reach them, and a prolongation
of the bones of the neck (the giraffe has
only the usual seven cervical vertebræ) and of the
fore-legs would ensue, especially in the young; this
prolongation would be handed on by inheritance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and so by degrees the new type of animal would be
evolved. The horn of the rhinoceros, the antlers of
the stag, the canine teeth of beasts of prey, the flat
grinders of ruminants, the flippers of the whale, the
proboscis of the honey-feeding butterfly, the jaws of
the ant or the beetle, and a host of other adaptations
which seem obviously to owe their origin to
the exercise of their functions, occur to the mind in
confirmation of this theory.</p>

<p>Besides Adaptation, we have what appears the
strikingly confirmatory case of what is called Co-adaptation,
where the variation of one organ or
structure in an animal puts a strain upon other parts,
which accordingly respond by auxiliary adaptations.
Such co-adaptations are numerous in every animal
structure, and, as we cannot suppose them to have
all originated simultaneously and by chance, the
conclusion drawn by Lamarckians is that one was
produced by use, and, in the course of its development,
produced the others in the same way. A typical
case is that of the Irish elk. The enormous antlers
of this beast, sometimes weighing a hundredweight,
must have needed (besides other structural changes)
a cervical ligament of immense size and power to
support them, and from the peculiar structure of the
cervical vertebræ it is demonstrable that such a ligament
must have existed. What more natural than
to suppose that the antlers were developed by fighting
wild beasts of prey, combats between male elks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
etc., and that then in their gradual growth, as the
species was evolved, the ligament and the bony
structure associated with it responded to the increasing
strain. That is exactly what would happen
in an individual. We have only to assume the
heritability of modifications acquired by use to
understand how these co-adaptations became constant
characters in a species.</p>

<p>Not less apparent cogency for the argument for
modifications by use have those cases where the
modification has been apparently due to disuse. It
is well known that living creatures found in the total
darkness of great limestone caverns, like those at
Kentucky, are blind, through imperfections of one
kind or another in the organs of sight. But the
rudimentary structures which remain tell us that
these creatures had ancestors which were once fully
equipped in this respect, and which had wandered
into the caverns from the sunlit outer world. Thus
the case of a crab has been noted, in which the stalks
on which a crab’s eyes are set were preserved, while
the eyes had disappeared: it is, as Darwin observes,
as if the stand of a telescope had been retained while
the telescope itself had gone. Sometimes the eyes
of cave-fishes are covered with a horny layer, sometimes
the whole structure is atrophied and withered.
But never is an animal found under these conditions
which has retained its power of sight. The conclusion
seems obvious. In individuals, a muscle or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
other organ is known to strengthen and develop
by use and to atrophy by disuse. As use and
disuse appear to be invariably accompanied by precisely
the same effects in the species as in the individual,
and as there seems no way of accounting
for this by any known physiological law without assuming
that modifications acquired by the individual
are transmitted to its progeny, the case for the inheritability
of such modifications appears, at first sight,
irresistible.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>So matters stood when Darwin’s <span class="smcap">Origin of Species</span>
carried the argument for evolution a long step
further. Accepting fully the views of Lamarck,
Darwin attempted, by his doctrine of Natural Selection,
first to reinforce those views, secondly to explain
much that they could not be made to cover. It is plain
that <i>if we assume the existence of a severe competition for
livelihood among the members of a species</i>, any favour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>able
variations of structure or instinct which may
occur among certain members of the species will
give their type an advantage over the normal type
in the struggle for existence. They will, on the
average, live longer and produce more offspring.
Ultimately, as the struggle for life is always most
severe among nearly related organisms, which seek
a living from the same sources, the less perfectly
equipped type will be extinguished, and so on, until
a species exhibiting the most complete form of
adaptation has been evolved. The variations on
which Natural Selection has to work are produced,
according to Darwin, not only by the exercise of
particular organs as in Lamarck’s theory, but also
and more potently by “innate variations” originating
from unascertained causes in the reproductive cells.
Variations, it is indisputable, are always occurring;
probably no two members of any species exactly
resemble each other. Among low and primitive
organisms, such as the <i>Foraminifera</i>, Dr. W. B.
Carpenter (I quote from A. R. Wallace’s <span class="smcap">Darwinism</span>)
found, on careful examination, the range of variation
so great that characteristics typical not merely
of species but of genera and even of orders were
liable to vary,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> while at the other end of evolution,
in man, to give only one instance, Mr. J. Wood
is stated by Darwin to have observed no less than
five hundred and fifty-eight variations in the muscu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>lar
structure of thirty-six subjects examined.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The
cause of these variations is often quite obscure, but
it is certain that some kinds of them are capable
of arising as the natural response of the organism to
changed conditions of food or habitat Conditions such
as these, affecting the whole constitution of the organism,
have been proved capable of affecting the reproductive
cells, and thus of giving rise to hereditary
characteristics. Natural Selection, then, by preserving
and encouraging the better fitted as opposed to the
less fit, acts as a spur to the Lamarckian principles
of development by exercise of function, while it also
lays hold of and intensifies all kinds of other favourable
variations occurring either casually or in consequence
of change of habitat, and weeds out the types
in which such variations happen to be unfavourable.
According to Darwin, therefore, given (1) constant
variations of structure arising from use, disuse, or
from other known or unknown causes, (2) the capacity
to transmit by inheritance these variations <i>whether innate
or acquired</i>, (3) a constant struggle for existence
among organisms both against each others’ competition
and against the general conditions of life<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>—given
these simple data, the secret springs of evolution are
laid bare, and the vast complexity of natural forms
upon the globe is adequately accounted for without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>calling in the agency of special creations. But
variations are the starting-point in the process:
Natural Selection can originate nothing—it can only
act on what is presented to it by some quite different
force. The relative parts played by the various
agencies at work are, with characteristic moderation
of statement, thus described by Darwin:—</p>

<p class="quot">“On the whole I think we may conclude that habit,
use, and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable
part in the modification of the constitution, and in the
structure of various organs; but that the effects of use and
disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes
overmastered by the natural selection of innate
variations.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>To explain evolution, then, we must first explain
<i>the occurrence of appropriate variations</i>, strong enough
and widespread enough to maintain themselves
against the constant reducing influence of promiscuous
intercrossing, and they must be variations
<i>capable of being transmitted by inheritance</i>. This, we
now see, is the true field of the inquiry.</p>

<p class="tb">The new factors introduced by Darwin into the
process of evolution—Natural Selection and Innate
Variations—were destined in our day to have the
whole weight of the argument for evolution suddenly
thrown upon them. The inheritability of variations
acquired by the individual through use and disuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>when subjected to fresh investigation by the younger
school of biologists has turned out to be open to the
gravest doubts, both theoretically, on account of the
great difficulty of reconciling it with what has now
been ascertained of the nature of the reproductive
mechanism in plants and animals, and also on the
score of a closer consideration of the facts commonly
adduced as evidence for the law. To take
these points separately: The reproductive cells in
every living creature are now believed to be formed
directly from the reproductive cells of its parents.
They are not a product of the organism in which
they find themselves. They are nourished by its
blood, and are therefore liable to be affected by anything
which produces a broad general effect on the
constitution of the being in whom they are lodged,
but it is difficult to see how special modifications of
individual parts of that being could affect them so as
to influence the determinants in the direction of reproducing
that modification. How, for example,
could the habit of grubbing for roots in an animal of
the pig tribe so affect its reproductive cells as to
ensure the birth of an offspring with callosities on
their snouts? The physiological mechanism by
which such a result could be produced seems hardly
conceivable—at any rate no one has yet offered a
plausible conception of it. Of course if the <i>fact</i> were
indisputably proved one would only have to accept
it, and endeavour, if possible, to discover the why and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
how. But the fact, which once looked so solidly
established, is taking on a more and more insubstantial
appearance in the light of closer investigation.</p>

<p>The argument against Lamarckism rests on the
basis (1) artificial experiment, (2) of observation
of nature under normal conditions.</p>

<p>As to the evidence from experiment, opinions
fluctuated for some time—Darwin was disposed at
one time to deny, at another to admit the alleged
proofs it offered. In the present day opinion is overwhelmingly
against the validity of these proofs.
The cases where artificially produced mutilations are
said to have been inherited have, when investigated,
turned out to be by no means as clear and trustworthy
as was supposed, nor can one place much
reliance on a few cases of striking coincidence such
as are certain to occur from time to time.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>The adverse instances are very clear indeed.
Chinese girls are never born with abnormally small
feet. Jews are not born circumcised. Among tribes
where tattooing is practised, no traces of this embellishment
are ever found to be inherited. If it is a
physiological law that the disuse of an organ not only
atrophies it in the individual but (by inheritance of
the atrophy) eliminates it from the species, there is
no apparent reason why this law should not operate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>in cases where the organ is artificially removed. Yet
it rarely or never seems to do so. Experiments
upon animals, such as breeding for many generations
from mice whose tails have been cut off, have never
resulted in producing a clear case of inherited mutilation.
A strong presumption is therefore raised that
the effects apparently due to use and disuse under
natural conditions (as in the eyeless fishes of the
Kentucky caves) must be set down to some other
cause. The queens in colonies of ants and bees have
never exercised the functions of workers for thousands
of centuries, yet they transmit these functions
unimpaired.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a case often referred to in this
connexion which must be here mentioned. Dr.
Brown-Séquard found that by injuring or compressing
the sciatic nerve in guinea-pigs epilepsy was
produced, and that the descendants of animals so
injured had a marked tendency to epileptic fits.
This is undoubtedly a very significant and important
fact in biology, but it gives no support to the
Lamarckian theory. What is inherited by the guinea-pigs
is not the injury to the nerve but the pathological
condition resulting therefrom. It remains to
be discovered how, precisely, this takes place, and
the experiment may end in illuminating a very
obscure region in physiology, but on Lamarckism it
has no bearing at all. A better case is that of atrophy
of a toe, which is said to have been inherited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
consequence of its original production by severance
of the sciatic nerve, but, again, what is inherited is
not an actual injury but an effect of it. It is clear,
however, that bodily conditions of a large and comprehensive
kind produced naturally or artificially in
an individual may have an effect on the reproductive
cells, especially when the nervous system is affected.</p>

<p>Coming to the observation of what happens under
natural conditions, we are struck at the outset by the
fact that the inheritance of acquired characteristics,
if it works at all, must work under some system of
salutary control and not as a blind physiological law.
For if each generation starts with some measure
at least of what the former generation had acquired,
and adds to it by its own activity, then all acquired
characteristics would ere long attain a monstrous
development, and the species would perish under
them. But nothing of the kind is observed to happen.
The continual use of the muscles in the labouring
classes has not made men stronger than they were
thousands of generations ago. The habit of handling
the spade and hoe has never produced a peasant
child born with callosities on its hands. The horn
of the rhinoceros, which on Lamarckian principles
we must regard as developed by the gradual increase
of a callosity formed by grubbing for roots, does
not grow beyond a certain size, however the species
may go on grubbing. The Lamarckian law, then,
if it has any real effect at all, can only express half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the truth about the action of heredity on acquired
characteristics. As the column of water in a fountain
hovers about a certain height, so the action of heredity
in the accumulation of the effects produced by the
use of organs seems to have a limit beyond which it
cannot pass. May it not be that heredity is really
as false an expression for the phenomenon as the
popular superstition about ‘water seeking its own
level’ is for the upspringing of a fountain?</p>

<p>The cases of co-adaptation, where one organ appears
to be developed by use and others by the use of that,
as in the case of the Irish elk referred to above,
are met by instances just as striking where the elements
of modification by use cannot come into play.
Weismann mentions the case of the ingenious brush
arrangement on the anterior legs of the bee, which
the insect uses for cleansing its antennæ. Two
adaptations are here developed—a little semicircular
notch in the leg, set with small bristles, and a movable
projection or flap used for pressing the antenna
into the notch as it is drawn through. The bee,
no doubt, would naturally try to clean its antennæ
with its fore-legs, but how could this process develop
the special arrangements referred to in the hard or
scaly covering of its limbs? It is not until the
shell of the insect has grown quite hard and incapable
of further vital changes that the arrangement
comes into use. Again, the stridulating noise
produced by the legs of the grasshopper is due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
serrations occurring on different joints of the limb.
Serrations on one joint would in no way tend to
develop them on the other, but rather the contrary,
yet there they are, in harmonious co-operation. If
Nature can obtain these effects, as she does in
numberless instances, without the aid of Lamarck’s
principle, we cannot help asking whether that principle
is ever operative at all.</p>

<p>The three instances which we shall next consider
seem to offer very serious obstacles to the Lamarckian
theory.</p>

<p>A modification of structure caused by the special
use of a certain organ takes place in probably over
90 per cent of the whole human race, male and
female. The records of art, of language, and the
evidence of actual remains, tend to show that the
habitude in question, with the attendant modification,
goes back to very ancient, even perhaps to
palæolithic times.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> I refer to the preferential use
of the right hand and the enlargement of structure
thus brought about in the right hand and arm.
Every right-handed adult man and woman shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>this enlargement of bony and muscular structure. The
origin of the habitude does not concern us here.
Let us suppose it due, as Dr. D. J. Cunningham
suggests, to “a transmitted functional pre-eminence
of the left brain,”<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> which is larger than the right, and
which governs the movements of the right side of
the body. However this may be, it is clear that if
bodily characteristics acquired by exercise are transmissible
by inheritance the new-born child of right-handed
ancestry ought to show some appreciable
preponderance in weight and size of the right over
the left limb. There could hardly be a more crucial
test of the validity of the Lamarckian principle.
What do the investigations of the dissecting-room
reveal? I shall quote the two most recent authorities
who have studied this interesting question.
Dr. Cunningham, in the lecture already referred to,
writes:—</p>

<p class="quot">“Although the matter has not been investigated so fully
as to place the question outside the region of dispute, the
evidence at our disposal distinctly favours the view that at
birth the two upper limbs start upon their individual duties
equally endowed in so far as strength of muscle and size of
bones are concerned. Both in mass and weight the two
limbs are to all intents and purposes similar at birth, and
the preponderance in bulk and strength which later on
distinguishes the right arm is acquired during life, and
is caused by the greater amount of work it is called upon
to perform.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. T. G. Moorhead, Chief Demonstrator in
Anatomy in Trinity College, Dublin, after giving
the results of the researches of various other inquirers,
writes:—</p>

<p class="quot">“From this mass of conflicting evidence I am forced to
the conclusion that no real differences exist.... After
weighing as a whole the limbs of eight foetuses I was
unable to detect any constant difference.”<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>These results appear to conflict most seriously
with the theory of the transmissibility of acquired
modifications.</p>

From Weismann’s <span class="smcap">The Evolution Theory</span>.<br />

K, the head; B, the limbs.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the fact that species of
animals which are preyed on by others, or which
require to be inconspicuous for the purpose of preying,
are very apt to take the colour of their habitual
surroundings. Individuals of the same species will
even differ according to their special habitat. Perhaps
the most marvellous instances of this kind of
adaptation are to be found in certain tropical butterflies,
such as the Indian butterfly, <i>Kallima paralecta</i>,
here illustrated. We have here, painted on the
butterfly’s wing, the picture of a leaf belonging to a
shrub which it frequents—a picture, when seen under
natural conditions, capable of baffling all but the closest
inspection. The different parts—the midrib, the
lateral veinings, the little blotches and spots which
represent patches of mould or drops of water, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>the outer contour of the wing itself—all form an
harmonious whole composed of related parts which
have separately no meaning or use. They certainly
did not all appear in full development at the same time.
Nor could any one of them, if it appeared first, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
exercised the smallest influence on the appearance
of the others, as the antlers of the elk were supposed
to have influenced the development of the <i>ligamentum
nuchæ</i>. The early stages must have been anticipatory
of the later ones, but exercise could have
had nothing to do with the result from first to
last. The butterfly never practised looking like a
leaf. Nor can any large chemical and elemental
influences have been at work. If nature is capable
of producing such effects as this without the agency
of Lamarck’s principle, are there not excellent
grounds for seeking for some other agency which
will cover all the phenomena alike?</p>

<p>Finally let us take the case of the slave-owning
‘Amazon’ ants, <i>Polyergus rufescens</i>. Here we have
a case which at the first blush looks like a perfect
picture of an evolutionary process conducted on the
principles of Lamarck’s theory. These ants, it may
be supposed, were originally of the ordinary type
of that industrious and respectable insect, but they
were led by the weakness of some of their neighbours
of another species to make occasional attacks
on them for the purpose of carrying off their immature
brood, the <i>pupæ</i>, as food. Some of these
<i>pupæ</i>, near maturity at the period of their capture,
would come out while stored-up in the nest of the
conquerors, and when they did so would immediately
set about doing the household work of the hive as
if they were at home. <i>Polyergus rufescens</i> ultimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
became aware that a life of aristocratic leisure
awaited him if he only captured enough <i>pupæ</i> of
another species of ant to do his work. He accordingly
confined himself entirely to piratical expeditions
of this nature, and in the course of time
underwent a moral and physical transformation of
a most remarkable kind. The ordinary ant instincts
have disappeared in this variety. They do not make
their nests, they do not gather stores, they do not
mind their young, they do not even feed themselves—an
Amazon ant will perish of starvation in the
presence of food if there is not a slave ant to put
it into his mouth. But they fight ferociously in their
slave-raids, and the form of their mandible has
changed to suit their mode of life. It has become
a pair of sabre-like nippers, excellent for slaying a
foe, but ill-adapted for carrying objects and other
industrial occupations. Corresponding changes have
taken place in the head and in the chitinous and
muscular structure.</p>

<p>We have before us, then, what would seem to an
uninformed observer, a striking picture of the acquirement
of a certain bodily form and a certain
set of instincts by use, and the total loss of other
traits by disuse, and of the fixing of these characters
in a species by heredity. Yet the picture is altogether
an illusion. However we are to explain the
facts—of which more anon—we cannot do so by
Lamarckism, for the simple reason that the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
instincts and bodily structure of the Amazon ants
are confined to the so-called ‘worker,’ or in this case
‘soldier,’ caste, which are sexless, and incapable
of reproducing their kind. If these were the individuals
which originally started the slave system
among the species, they could not possibly have
transmitted the modifications, moral and physical,
which they acquired. The queen-ants, which normally
are the only fertile ants, transmit them, but do
not possess them, and neither do the drones.</p>

<p>The case of these mysterious communities of insects,
composed largely of neuters which do the
work of the community but do not reproduce their
kind, was one of the difficulties in the way of
Darwin’s theory of evolution which, he said, staggered
him every time he reflected on it.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> It is not
surprising, therefore, that this difficulty came to be
the battlefield, or a main position thereof, in a most
interesting and illuminating controversy on Natural
Selection <i>versus</i> Lamarckism, waged between Mr.
Herbert Spencer and Dr. Weismann in the years
1893-4.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Spencer considered the inheritance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>acquired characteristics a factor in evolution of the
very first importance; and so, indeed, from his point
of view it is. “Either,” he declared, “there has been
inheritance of acquired characteristics, or there has
been no evolution.” Met by the case, among others,
of the slave-making ants, his explanation is substantially
as follows: It was not the workers (soldiers)
which originally acquired military traits, but the
queens, the fully developed females, which lost them.
There was once, as every one admits, a time when all
ants, bees, etc. were sexually mature. There were
only males and females. At this stage, possibly, the
Amazon ants were already predatory. It was <i>then</i>
that they may have acquired the military habits and
structure, which they were then able to perpetuate by
inheritance.</p>

<p>How, then, did the queens lose these traits?” From
the queens,” replies Spencer, “they have slowly disappeared
by inheritance of the effects of disuse.”
The obvious and unanswerable rejoinder made by
Weismann and his followers was that Spencer had
only shifted the difficulty to another ground—from
the workers to the queens. If the queens (and
drones) lost the military characteristics by disuse,
how do they come to transmit them unimpaired to
the workers? It is the very essence of Lamarckism
that whatever modifications are produced by use or
by disuse shall be transmissible by inheritance.</p>

<p>In this controversy, however, there was another string<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
to the Lamarckian bow. Worker-ants, bees, etc. are
imperfectly developed females. They have four or five
egg-tubes where the queen has two hundred, but they
cannot be fertilized by the drones. It occasionally
happens, however, that these neuter insects do lay a
few eggs. These unfertilized eggs always develop
into drones. One of these drones might, it was
suggested, now and then fertilize a genuine queen,
and thus hand on the traits of the worker from which
it sprang. But apart from the fact that an occasional
occurrence of this sort would hardly suffice to maintain
the worker-characteristics unimpaired throughout
the ages, there is the decisive answer, as Weismann
points out, that we know at least one species of ant in
which the evolution of a neuter caste is absolutely
complete, for the workers of <i>Tetramorium caespitum</i>
possess no egg-tubes at all. Yet the transmission of
characteristics from queens and drones who never
exercise them to workers who cannot pass them on,
goes forward in this species of any ant just as in any
other.</p>

<p>Nature, therefore, while doing in the case of these
insect communities exactly what she appears to be
doing elsewhere by the accumulation of acquired
characteristics, must, in reality, have been working
on entirely different lines. If we can discover what
those lines were, they will cover the apparently
Lamarckian cases as well, but the Lamarckian principle
certainly will not cover these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next chapter we shall review the alternative
explanation offered by Darwinism, the explanation
of Weismann; and we shall see whether Spencer
was not as successful in demolishing it as Weismann
was in showing that, if evolution exists at all, some
other basis must be found for it than that on which
it was so largely rested by Herbert Spencer.</p>

<p class="indent">THE MECHANICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION:
THE DARWIN-WEISMANN
EXPLANATION</p>

God alone!”—<span class="smcap">Menander.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="dropcap2">“</span><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the end,” writes M. Edmond Perrier, “every imaginable
theory of evolution must lead up to one or
other of two absolute doctrines, essentially antagonistic to
each other. Either the inheritance of acquired characteristics
must be admitted in its full scope (<i>dans toute sa
généralité</i>), or else we must believe in the predestination of
protoplasm, developing by virtue of its own internal forces.
But in the latter case we pass from the domain of pure
science to enter that of metaphysics.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>We have now to consider the most conspicuous
attempt made in recent times to escape from this
tragic dilemma.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<p>If the acquired and inherited variations of the Lamarckian
theory drop out as a contribution to the
explanation of evolution, we are reduced to two
forces only—<i>innate</i>, or germinal, variability of offspring,
and natural selection. Indeed it might be
said that we are reduced to variability alone, since
natural selection can do nothing until suitable variations
are presented to it. The suitable variations do,
however, turn up, and the question is, what causes
them? The real difficulty for the school of biologists
who, like Weismann, “assume the mechanical theory
of the world to be correct,” is how to reconcile the
aptness and apparent purposefulness of these variations
with any mechanical theory.</p>

<p class="quot">“We are justified in inquiring,” writes Weismann,
“whether the assumption of ‘chance’ germinal variations,
which we have hitherto made with Darwin and Wallace,
affords a sufficient basis for selection. Osborn says very
neatly in this connection, ‘We see with Weismann and
Galton the element of chance; but the dice appear to be
loaded, and in the long run turn “sixes” up. Here arises
the question, What loads the dice?’”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>What loads the dice? There is the great question in
which the realms of biology and of philosophy meet
each other! Through that borderland no definite
frontier has ever been traced, for in thought as in
matter the saying is true that natural groupings have
nuclei, but no boundaries. It is all the more essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>that men of science should understand philosophy
and its methods, and that philosophers should understand
science. It is to be feared that at present the
second of these desiderata is much more fully realized
than the first.</p>

<p>However, we have to see now what Weismann,
protagonist among contemporary biologists of the
mechanical theory of the world, has to answer to
the crucial question which he has allowed Osborn to
set him.</p>

<p class="tb">The problem is to discover how innate, germinal
variations can come about, of such a nature as to
adapt an organism with striking accuracy to its
surroundings and way of life, without our assuming
either (1) that the exercise of function had any influence
in causing heritable variations, or (2) that they
were caused by any non-mechanical power, which, so
to speak, had in view the objects which they fulfil.
For the variations are to be regarded, on Weismann’s
theory of life, as completely <i>fortuitous</i> in
respect of the objects they serve. How, then, do
they come to serve them, in most cases, so admirably
well?</p>

<p>The general nature of Weismann’s explanation
may be summed up in a curious illustration given by
him in <span class="smcap">The Evolution Theory</span>.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> Let us suppose, he
says, a snow-field surrounded by precipices on all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>sides, but with a narrow track leading away from it
at one point. Scattered about on the snow-field are
a number of persons. A sleigh is now projected
among them from some outside point. Each person,
when the sleigh comes near him, gives it a push, but
he has no object in pushing it anywhere in particular,
and simply sends it flying off in whatever direction
he chances to be looking. What will happen under
these circumstances? After more or less bandying
about, the sleigh will, in the vast majority of cases,
fall into one of the abysses round the snow-field and
be lost But another is then launched on to the
snow-field, and then another and another without
end; and so, at last, it may happen that a series of
pushes will take place which will send the sleigh over
the narrow track to its goal.</p>

<p>The goal is supposed to represent some condition
to which the organism (the sleigh) has to adapt itself.
The random pushes which it receives are the multitude
of variations constantly occurring in the reproductive
cells. Most of these variations have no
decisive tendency, favourable or unfavourable. If a
series of unfavourable ones should occur, leading to
some development which markedly impairs the
chances of the organism for success in life, it, or its
line of succession, dies out, and the unfavourable
variation is, therefore, not perpetuated. This is
illustrated by the sleigh going into the abyss. But
if a favourable variation occurs, and is increased till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
it reaches ‘selection value,’ <i>i.e.</i> till it gives the
organisms possessing it a distinct advantage over
others in the battle of life, then this favoured type
will ultimately, by the action of natural selection,
drive out the less favoured, and will establish itself
as the sole representative of the species. Having
reached this level, of course the same process will go
on further indefinitely.</p>

<p>Before criticizing this conception of evolutionary
processes, we must inquire into the vital point of
how the variations, the random pushes given to the
sleighs, ever rise to such intensity as to have selection-value,
and to make head against the influence of
intercrossing. The explanation is certainly ingenious,
but is so purely hypothetical and has an air so
fantastic that it has commended itself to very few
students of biology. Weismann would have us suppose
that the determinants of which the hereditary
substance in the reproductive cells is made up are
carrying on with each other an incessant struggle for
nutriment. If one of them succeeds in getting a
little more than its neighbours it thereby grows
stronger, and is able to attract still more nutriment
to itself, and to impoverish those around it. It is
thus launched, as it were, on an ascending scale, and
will go on automatically if the variation caused by
it proves favourable to the species. If it proves unfavourable
(which <i>ex hypothesi</i> it is just as likely to
do) its career will be put a stop to by the extinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the line of descent which inherits this variation.
Weismann’s theory of “Germinal Selection” is therefore
simply an application to the reproductive cell
and its contents of the Darwinian principle of Natural
Selection.</p>

<p>The theory is one which plainly makes immense
demands upon our faith. As regards the existence
of a continual competition among the determinants,
there may be reason to accept it, but hardly in the
Weismann sense. Suppose two parents to unite,
one healthy, well-nourished, full-blooded, the other
starved and weakly, it is very likely that, in the
resulting offspring, other things being equal, the
determinants coming from the well-nourished frame
will be seen to have surpassed in potency those from
the weakly one. For the determinants are living
protoplasm—they depend on nourishment derived
from the blood of the organism in which they are
lodged, and they are capable, no doubt, of being well-nourished
or ill-nourished or possibly over-nourished,
according to the constitution and history of that
organism. But this is a very different thing from
supposing that one determinant can begin to grow in
<i>the same cell</i> at the expense of another, when both
are absolutely embedded in an ocean of the same
nutritive matter. There is not—of course in the
nature of things there cannot be—a particle of evidence
for the supposition. It is a pure imaginative
hypothesis, and on the face of it a most improbable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
one. It is difficult to believe that it could ever have
been adopted save as a desperate attempt to break
through the ever-narrowing ring of evidence which is
forcing investigation more and more towards a non-mechanical
explanation of the processes of life. But
even if it were true, what is gained by it? “Appropriate
variational tendencies,” writes Weismann,
“not only <i>may</i> present themselves, they <i>must</i> do so,
if the germ-plasm contains determinants at all by
whose fluctuations in a plus or minus direction the
appropriate variation is attainable.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> But why <i>must</i>
they? There is no ‘must’ about Chance, unless one
extends its operations to infinity. Why is it so certain
that the inequalities of nutriment, on which
hereditary variability is supposed to depend, must
necessarily run the gamut of all possible variations?
There is no ‘must’ in this theory, except that it is
the last ditch of the “mechanical conception of the
economy of life.” It ‘must’ be true—or that conception
must quit the field.</p>

<p>Were evolution to depend on the occurrence, by
pure chance, of a few appropriate variations among a
vast multitude of indifferent or disadvantageous ones,
is it conceivable that we should find in nature anything
like the infinite wealth of closely and beautifully
adapted structure which is actually present? In particular,
how are we to account for the cases in which
a number of parts are so modified as to work together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>in harmonious co-adaptation? Each of these parts,
according to Weismann, originates quite independently
of the others. Take the case of the Indian
leaf-butterfly already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> The first beginnings
of the midrib on Weismann’s theory had nothing to
do with the rest of the rib, nor had any of the veinings
with this, or with one another; and the contour
of the leaf, sending out a little projection like a stalk
<i>exactly where the midrib starts</i>, originated quite independently
of that marking, and equally so of the
leaf it mimics! To explain co-adaptations like this
on Weismann’s theory is really much the same as to
suppose that a picture could be painted by simply
plastering the scrapings of a palette on a canvas, if
only one continued the process long enough. And
the marvel in question, the co-adaptation of various
parts, has not been attained once or twice but, to a
greater or less degree, in <i>every</i> organism possessing
any structural complexity.</p>

<p>The difficulty, of course, has not escaped Weismann.
His explanation depends on some conception of the
potentialities of conjugation and intercrossing which
I confess I cannot understand. He finds the key to
the mystery in the mingling and constant recombination
of determinants from different individuals produced
by promiscuous intercrossing. “It is only
through amphimixis [conjugation] that simultaneous
harmonious adaptation of many parts becomes pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>sible.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
But surely this continual mingling and recombination
would, <i>primâ facie</i>, be just as likely
to break up co-adaptations already forming as to give
rise to new ones? Amphimixis, as we have seen, is
one of the most potent forces against which the
evolution of a new species has to contend. Evolution
has to make head against the constant tendency of
intercrossing to obliterate individual distinctions.
True, if parents exhibiting the same heritable variation
unite, their offspring will have that variation
in a strongly marked form, and will transmit it
further. But this, to be of value for evolution, presupposes
the same variation occurring simultaneously
in a number of individuals within reach of
each other. Weismann had indeed good reason to
ascribe to the action of intercrossing “a wealth and
diversity of organic architecture otherwise unattainable,”
but were it not supplemented by an architectural
instinct of nature, the only architecture
attainable would be that of the child when it empties
its bricks on the floor.</p>

<p>Consider the theory of germinal selection in the
light of the following very curious case.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Most
people have seen an example of the kind of spectacles
having what are called bifocal lenses. Each lens is
divided across the centre, and the focal lengths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the upper and the lower halves are different. They
are intended for persons who see indistinctly both at
near and at far distances—the upper half of the lens
is used for looking at distant objects and the lower
for reading, etc., so as to avoid the inconvenience of
having a different pair of glasses for each requirement.
Now there is a fish, named <i>Anableps</i> (the
Uplooker), living in estuaries on the east coast of
South America which actually has its eye-lenses
constructed on this principle. The pupil of the eye
is divided laterally by prolongations from the iris.
The significance of this extraordinary arrangement is
that the fish is in the habit of swimming near the
surface, and often has its eyes wholly or partly out
of water, presumably to look out for attacks from
birds of prey. The upper half of the eye has become
adapted for vision in the air and the lower for vision
in the water.</p>

<p>According to Weismann, the habits and needs of
the fish could have had no influence whatever in
producing this peculiar adaptation as an inherited
characteristic of a species. Any other fish or mammal
would have been just as likely as <i>Anableps</i> to begin
the development of a bifocal eye. How does it come,
then, that from the thousands of species of eyed
animals one, and one only, possesses this bifocal eye,
and that precisely the one which so greatly needs it?
Weismann’s answer would doubtless be that, in the
case of other creatures, Natural Selection would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
have acted in protecting the individuals which possessed
the bifocal eye and penalizing those which did
not. But can we imagine that this principle acted
very strongly when the bifocal arrangement in
<i>Anableps</i> was in a mere rudimentary stage, as it must
at first have been? And should we not occasionally
see at least traces of the arrangement in the eyes of
other creatures, if its full development in <i>Anableps</i>
was merely the result of Natural Selection laying
hold of and perfecting an originally quite fortuitous
variation?</p>

<p>A case still more curious and convincing occurs in
connexion with the hermaphroditism exhibited by a
whole class of animals belonging to many different
orders, but alike in the one respect that it is specially
desirable for them to have both sexes comprised in
the same individual. These are animals capable only
of sluggish movement, the different sexes of which
have therefore some difficulty in finding each other
out. Terrestrial snails and slugs are an example.
All these creatures are double-sexed; any two snails
which meet can conjugate, since each can act either
as male or as female at will. Oysters are another
instance, though in this case the two sexes follow
each other at different periods in the life-history of
each individual. Clearly, this faculty gives to snails
and slugs twice as many opportunities of reproducing
their kind as if the sexes were distinct. It is certain
from general biological considerations that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
distinct originally. One can easily understand how,
if any small group of the original species from which
all the present tribes are descended, happened to
throw up these bisexual peculiarities, their progeny
would multiply faster than the rest and might ultimately
exterminate them by the operation of natural
selection. <i>But exactly the same might be said of any
other tribe of unisexual animals.</i> Any of these might,
<i>a priori</i>, on the “mechanical conception of the
economy of life,” be just as reasonably expected to
develop bisexuality; for no one supposes that there
is any physical connexion between sluggishness and
hermaphroditism, or swiftness and distinction of the
sexes; and the causes which have operated to extend
and confirm the type in sluggish and sedentary
animals would have the same effect in swift ones.
Yet this remarkable adaptation occurs just wherever
there is special need for it; there always and there
only. What mechanism can account for such a
phenomenon as this? No; the dice are loaded.
Nature gains her end slowly and not without hesitations
and failures, but the phenomena are wholly
unlike the results of the play of uncontrolled and
fortuitous forces. Imagine a blindfolded archer
shooting arrows upwards, downwards, and all around
him in every direction as it may take his fancy.
There is, unknown to him, a target some distance off.
If he went on long enough it is conceivable, though
by no means necessary, that some arrow would hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the bull’s eye. But the facts plainly point not to the
above analogy, but rather to an aim at a desired
object. Some of the arrows miss, some light near
the mark, others hit it precisely. The flight, on the
whole, is in the right direction, as the immense proportion
of complete or partial successes plainly
proves.</p>

<p class="tb">The two pillars of Weismann’s theory of evolution
are <i>germinal variation</i> and <i>natural selection</i>. The
one is supposed to originate ceaseless changes of
structure, the other to eliminate those changes which
are useless<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> or unfavourable and to foster and confirm
the favourable. We have seen, if the foregoing
considerations are sound, that fortuitous variations do
not provide the material with which natural selection
can build up a universe of organic life like ours. We
have now to turn our attention to the other prop
of the system and to inquire whether natural selection
can play and does play the part which Darwin
and his school assign to it in the economy of
nature.</p>

<p>Natural selection is supposed to depend for its
efficacy on the existence of a state of strenuous
competition for nourishment, or for the avoidance
of foes, in the type out of which the favourable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>variations emerge. But in recent times the fact of
any such competition has been gravely doubted. Let
us look back to the beginnings of animal life in the
world. The first primitive animal organisms found
themselves swimming in a boundless sea of nourishment
and had no foes at all! Yet they developed
into higher and higher grades of life. Competition
did not aid in the development of these higher
grades—it was they which ultimately created the
state of competition. What Nature then achieved
without competition she is equally able to perform
now. Even now when the earth is swarming with
varied life competition plays a much smaller part
than was taken for granted in the first flush of
Darwinism. Creatures of the same type but on
different grades of organization, like the hive-bee
and the humble bee, are constantly found side by
side, drawing their nourishment from the same
sources, but each holding its own without difficulty.
Facts like these were not unobserved by Darwin,
who met them by the supposition that competition
came chiefly into play at exceptional periods, during
a drought, an inundation, a severe winter, or the like,
in which the less fitted members of the race perished
wholesale. But, as Kropotkin, in his interesting work,
<span class="smcap">Mutual Aid among Animals</span>, has remarked,</p>

<p class="quot">“If the evolution of the animal world were based
exclusively, or even chiefly, upon the survival of the
fittest during periods of calamities; if natural selection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>were limited in its action to periods of exceptional drought,
or sudden changes of temperature, or inundations, retrogression
would be the rule in the animal world. Those
who survive a famine, or a severe epidemic of cholera, or
small-pox, or diphtheria, such as we see them in uncivilized
countries, are neither the strongest, nor the
healthiest, nor the most intelligent. No progress could
be based on such survivals—the less so as all survivors
usually come out of the ordeal with an impaired health,
like the Transbaikalian horses just mentioned, or the
Arctic crews, or the garrison of a fortress which has been
compelled to live for a few months on half rations, and
comes out of its experience with a broken health, and subsequently
shows a quite abnormal mortality.”<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>Kropotkin’s book shows good reason to believe
that the principle of mutual aid and support plays
at least as great a part in the animal world as does
that of mutual competition and extermination.</p>

<p>That the competition of organisms, animal and
vegetable, for nourishment and for protection may
favour certain types, and depress or even exterminate
others, is of course indisputable. We see it when
the Japanese worker and the Californian meet in industrial
rivalry on the Pacific slopes—we see it when
the willows planted by New Zealand rivers destroy
the weed which infested them, by absorbing the
nourishment from the river-bed on which it lived.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
What we have to consider, however, is the efficacy
of competition in giving predominance and per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>manence
to a type differing but slightly in the initial
stages from that of the rest of the species, and differing
but in a very few individuals. We have to consider,
in fact, whether natural selection is not a
consequence rather than a cause of evolution. On
no mechanical theory of evolution can we suppose
that the first leaf-markings of the butterfly, <i>Kallima
paralecta</i>, were either at all pronounced in their
mimicry, or that they originated simultaneously in
any large group of the original species from which
<i>Kallima paralecta</i> sprang. Therefore, with very small
advantage in the way of protection from enemies,
and with the constant and powerful influence of
intercrossing ever tending to obliterate the distinctive
leaf-marks, how could natural selection alone
enable the new, the mimicking type, to assert and
develop itself, as it has done not only in this
particular species of butterfly but in hundreds of
species of the <i>Lepidoptera</i> and other insects?</p>

<p class="quot">“A considerable initial resemblance,” writes Mr. Beddard
in his most valuable though somewhat chaotic work on
this subject,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> “may be fairly set down to other causes
[than natural selection]; because it is impossible to believe
that a slight move in the required direction would
be of sufficient importance to serve as material for the
action of natural elimination.”</p>

<p>The most convinced Darwinian will hardly deny that
the problem involved in this case is a serious one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Another singular fact to be noted in this connexion
is the “conclusion arrived at by the study of mimetic
butterflies in all parts of the world—that the females
are far more liable to assume this method of defence
than the males.”<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> An instance in point, which has
been the subject of much discussion, is that of the
yellow and black swallow-tailed butterfly, <i>Papilio
meriones</i>, found in Madagascar. The island is supposed
to be the original home of the species, and
here both sexes are much alike. On the mainland of
South Africa, however, while the male has undergone
the very slight transformations represented by the
species <i>P. merope</i> and <i>P. cenea</i>, the females imitate
closely three different species of the <i>Danais</i> butterfly
which is protected by its disagreeable taste from the
usual enemies of the tribe, and which is altogether
unlike in shape and coloration to the swallow-tail.
“The new forms,” writes Mr. Poulton, “have arisen at
so recent a date that many of the intermediate stages
can still be seen, while the parent form has been
preserved unchanged in a friendly land, where the
keener struggle of continental areas is unknown.”<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
The significance of such a fact as this is obvious. If
mimicry arose from fortuitous variations of colouring
and of form, males alone might show it in some
species, females alone in others, and both in yet
others, but it is difficult to understand how we could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>arrive at the actual condition, and find it either
common to both sexes or practically confined to the
female. If, on the other hand, mimicry and other
similar adaptations are ultimately to be interpreted
as the common response of the species to the
attack of its foes, it is quite natural that the
female, as the egg-bearer, the most important factor
in the continuance of the species, should be specially
protected. It is probable also that she is most in
need of protection, as her functions may render her
rather more exposed than the male to attack. That
natural selection cannot have been the dominant
factor in the case we are considering seems clear;
for how could it have acted at all without a somewhat
vigorous weeding out of unprotected forms?
And, in that case, what would have become of the
unprotected males of the species?</p>

<p>Difficulties of this kind have, in different cases,
been raised again and again since the publication of
the <span class="smcap">Origin of Species</span>, and have had to be answered
so often that there seems good <i>prima facie</i> ground
for doubting whether they have ever really been
answered at all. The strongest advocates of the pure
mechanical theory are obliged, as we have seen, to
admit that the drift of contemporary scientific
opinion is to place little reliance on casual variation
and natural selection and to look for the driving
force of evolution in other directions.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> In the intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>duction
to Strasburger’s <span class="smcap">Text Book of Botany</span><a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> we
find this important passage:—</p>

<p class="quot">“The tendency is to assume the existence of a development
of the organic world due to original, innate capabilities
of the living substance and not dependent on selection.
The origin of the large subdivisions of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, the ‘Archetypes,’ would be due to this
sort of evolution. These archetypes have been, and are
still, continually influenced by the environment, and, by
their reaction to external conditions, organisms become
more or less directly adapted.... The progressive evolution
of the archetypes, as well as the direct adaptations to
external conditions shown by them, is independent of
selection. The latter does, however, exert an influence on
the process of evolution of the organic world, though to a
much more limited extent than was formerly supposed.”</p>

<p>It is clear that in these <i>original innate capabilities
of the living substance</i> we have a power which alone
<i>may</i> fully account for the evolution of the organic
world, though natural selection can emphasize and
hasten its action. Its nature and limits are still undetermined.
Biologists are very chary of expressing
this power save in terms of chemistry and physics.
Men of science are afraid—sometimes I venture to
think even morbidly afraid—of opening any door
by which the fantastic horde of arbitrary dogmas
and superstitions which they have cast out with so
much toil and peril might find their way back into
the temple of Knowledge. But philosophy must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>warn them that in shutting out all forces that cannot
be weighed and measured in a laboratory they may
be shutting out life itself. And those who strenuously
insist on reducing nature to a mechanism often
find themselves obliged to let in the mysterious life-force
by some more or less clandestine entry in order
to make their mechanism work. Thus Nägeli, the
originator of the theory of heredity which Weismann
has developed, attributes the phenomena of growth
and evolution not to natural selection but to “internal
forces.”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> He disclaims for these forces any
but a physical and chemical significance; but Professor
Eimer, in spite of all disclaimers, cannot get
rid of the suspicion, well justified in my opinion,
that there is in these forces, as conceived by Nägeli,
something purposeful and teleological—admit them,
he says in effect, and who knows what we shall next
be asked to believe?<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Yet for Eimer himself we
find that, as Schopenhauer says, “the lotus of physics
is rooted in metaphysics.” Twice in his work on
organic evolution, he refers with approval to the
view of “our profound philosopher, Oken,”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> who
regarded all existing beings as members or organs
of some vast and transcendental organism whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>development conditioned theirs. Eimer even makes
a somewhat daring application of this principle to
a concrete instance in the physical world, one which
we have already referred to, the problem of the inheritance
of qualities in ants, bees, etc., when these
qualities are possessed and exercised only by individuals
who cannot transmit them.</p>

<p class="quot">“We must regard,” he writes, “the different forms of
bees, queens, drones, workers, as <i>discontinuous organs of
one whole</i>, which have been evolved from a single indifferent
ancestral form.... Only thus can we explain to ourselves
the fact that the peculiarities of the workers, notwithstanding
that they do not reproduce, are inherited.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>When we are asked to believe in physico-chemical
laws of such a nature that they enable the habits
of life of a worker-ant or bee to react upon the
germ-cells of the queen, just as the exercise of an
organ, on Lamarckian principles, affects the reproductive
cells of the creature to which it belongs, it
becomes plain enough that for modern investigators
the so-called mechanical and the so-called psychic
conceptions of the universe are really running out
at the same point. The gulf between these conceptions,
which seemed to yawn so widely after Darwinism,
was a mere illusion, arising from a point of
view now left behind.</p>

<p class="tb">To resume the argument of the foregoing chapters.
We have seen that at the basis of all theories of evo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>lution
lies the fact of the responsive powers of living
protoplasm. <i>But what does it respond to?</i> That is
the question of questions. To put it accurately in
relation to the process of evolution we must ask, To
what do the determinants in the germinal cells of
plants and animals respond? To what call did
unicellular organisms respond when they first began
to interchange chromatin with each other? To what,
when they began to divide and form new organisms?
To what, when multicellular organisms began to specialize
certain cells for reproduction, and these cells to
mature themselves for fusion by throwing out half
their chromosomes? And when the higher plants
and animals came on the scene, reproducing their
kind under conditions which make strongly for the
fixity of species, how are we to interpret the response
of protoplasm when we see organs and structures
melt away, and others grow, giving rise to the innumerable
types which yield us the existing world
with its overwhelming richness and variety of life?
Weismann tells us that the response is only to differences
in the amount of nutriment obtainable by the
various determinants of the germ cell, and has but a
fortuitous connexion with the results attained. We
have seen the inadequacy of this theory, in the light
of the many adaptations such as that of which the fish,
<i>Anableps</i>, with its bifocal eyes, and the double sexual
organs of terrestrial snails, are types. Lamarck and
Darwin, besides the belief in fortuitous variation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
held that heritable characters arise from exercise of
function. Innumerable cases can be quoted in favour
of this explanation, but we have seen instances in
which it is absolutely untenable, and yet where the
required response takes place just the same. The
influence of light and colour tells on the colouring
of animals, and impartially protects them when they
are preyed upon, or helps them to secure their prey;
and this influence is frequently explainable by
chemical or electric agencies originating in the
environment of the animal, acting on the blood,
and thus influencing pigmentation of the skin,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> but
chemistry is helpless to account for the manner
in which nature shapes the contour of the wing of
a tropical butterfly and paints upon it the veinings
of a leaf, or protects a harmless fly by giving it a
resemblance to a stinging one, or protects a caterpillar
by making it look like a vicious and dangerous
reptile. Yet all these protective arrangements are
evidently, at bottom, facts of the same order. Protoplasm
lives and responds not only discretely in the
lowest unit perceptible by the microscope, but collectively
in the connected groups of these units called
multicellular organisms, and in the disconnected
groups of these organisms called species. It really
responds not to the exercise of function or to the
play of physical forces, but to vital tendencies of the
organism. There seems an expansive force in nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>which, though working strictly under the dominion of
physical laws, is capable of using the combinations
brought about by those laws for the preservation and
development of life. It is in love with life, it is ever
pressing toward action and self-realization, and all
roads are one to it if they lead to that end. In it
are included the very chemical and physical agencies
which it obeys, and also that something beyond
which eludes the analysis of the laboratory.</p>

<p>How it acts, under what conditions, what limitations,
why here in one way, there in another, are
questions of profound interest, the fringe of which
philosophy has hardly begun to touch. Nor is
philosophy yet in a position to do more, for the
scientific conception of nature is but a recent birth
of thought; much remains to do in the collection and
organization of the facts with which the framework
must be filled in, and a philosophy which does not
keep closely in touch with scientific fact can have no
message for the modern world. But it does seem
possible to discern, and it shall now be our endeavour
to set forth, in broad outline, certain principles
of deep significance from which we may obtain
an answer to the question: What can we learn from
the physical universe that has a bearing on the
spiritual life of man?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="center">THE DIRECTIVE THEORY OF
EVOLUTION</p>

<p class="indent f90">“Who is there that cannot distinguish between the actual
cause of a thing and that without which the cause could
never be a cause?”—Plato, <span class="smcap">Phædo</span>.</p>

<p>The problem set at the close of our first
chapter was to find a fit explanation of the
guiding power apparent in natural phenomena. We
have not been able to interpret this guiding power
either in terms of conscious, intelligent contrivance
or in terms of blind, mechanical law. The investigations
which followed have led us up to another
explanation. We have seen that the vivifying, transforming,
progressive power in nature may be conceived
as a power of Response. Every particle of
matter, organic and inorganic, has this power. Every
particle of matter can react and respond to some
stimulus. The more it can respond to, the higher it
is in the scale of being. And we have found, as
I think, one constant and universal stimulus to which
both the fixity of nature’s laws and the plasticity of
her mysterious substance may be conceived as a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>sponse.
This stimulus is the call of Life. Stimulus
and response taken together constitute the directive
force in obedience to which the world unfolds itself
in the evolutionary process. We have been led to
interpret nature as the concrete expression of the
will to live, a will which for the first time comes into
rational consciousness in man. Having brought this
conception, I hope, into clear light, it is the aim
of the present chapter to illustrate and enforce it in
more detail, and thus to gain a secure foundation for
the application of the conception to the more strictly
human problems with which we have ultimately
to deal.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the existence in nature
of any directive power transcending and utilizing
the mechanical forces and relations of matter, call it
‘vital force,’ the ‘hand of Providence,’ the ‘<i>X</i>’
of evolution, or what one will, has never readily been
admitted by scientific naturalists. They feel that,
if once admitted, it offers a prompt and facile explanation
of every difficulty, and is available as the
cheap resource of all those who study nature with
a view to the grinding of their moral or religious
axes, rather than to the discovery of truth. Those
who feel obliged to believe in the existence of some
such power are therefore bound to be more than
ordinarily on their guard against all loose thinking.
They must not be content with vague generalities,
but must be prepared to indicate as exactly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
possible the distinction existing between the mechanical
and the non-mechanical or transcendental agencies
in nature. It does not follow that one’s account of
the matter will prove to be exactly true in every
detail. One must always speak in such matters
with that wise reservation of Socrates, “If this be
not the truth, something of the kind is.” But it is
not allowable to fall back on that “something of
the kind” until an attempt has been made definitely
to establish the “kind,” by searching into the inmost
heart of the fact.</p>

<p>The fact here is the responsive power of living
protoplasm. It will be well to examine it first in its
operation in an individual organism before we consider
it in relation to the species.</p>

<p>Reaction or response of a chemical and mechanical
type takes place alike in dead matter and in living
organisms, but certain stimuli will induce action in
an organism which they could not possibly induce in
a mineral. For in every cell, as Reinke well says,
there are a chemist and an architect who guide its
energies, and who have something quite different
from chemistry and physics in view. Consider the
following case. Every tuber of a potato plant is
covered with a light skin composed of a corky substance
intended to protect the internal structure from
injury. This skin is produced by the action of the
surface cells of the tuber. Chemically and physically
these cells are just the same as the cells in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
interior of the tuber. But the interior cells do not
produce this corky substance, because it would be
injurious to the plant if they did. The cells below
the surface of the tuber, though they are by no
means secluded from the chemical influences of the
earth around them, behave quite differently from those
actually in contact with the earth.</p>

<p>Now let us take our tuber, slice it in half, and
replace it in the earth again. If we look at it again
in a few days we shall find that the interior cells,
now exposed by the cutting, have done what they
could not or did not do before—they have produced
a layer of skin to cover the exposed surface of the
tuber just as if they had been surface cells from the
outset.</p>

<p>This kind of response seems to take us quite out
of the region of chemical and physical action as
understood in the case of inorganic matter. It is a
response directed to maintaining as far as possible
the life and form of the organism, a thing which mere
chemical action in mineral substances never does.</p>

<p>It may perhaps, however, be argued that the actual
contact with the earth has a possible chemical stimulus
which is not communicable to cells even a hair’s-breadth
below the surface, and that the cells laid
bare by slicing react as they do simply because they
are exposed to this stimulus. Let us take, then,
another common and typical case of response to
altered conditions in plant life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The taproot of a tree, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> grows
straight downwards towards the centre of the earth
in obedience to the stimulus given by the pull of
gravitation. The same stimulus impels the stem to
shoot upwards, and the other roots and the branches
to grow more or less laterally. New growth always
takes place at the extreme tip of the shoot or root.
Lay bare the taproot, cut away this growing tip, and
that root can grow no more; no fresh tip charged
with vegetative vitality can form itself over the scar.
But mark what happens! The nearest lateral root,
instead of pursuing its normal course, straightway
begins to bend downwards and takes the place of
the mutilated taproot. Similarly if the leading shoot
of the stem is nipped off, the nearest lateral branch
will turn upwards. In this case the lateral root or
shoot has not been subjected to any new influences
whatever, or at least to none of a chemical or physical
nature. Yet it responds, not to anything affecting
itself, but to the needs of the organism as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>None of the forces which living organisms have in
common with minerals will account for this kind of
response.</p>

<p>How are we to represent to our minds the nature
of the forces which apply to the innumerable cases
of which the above is a type? Reinke, who deals
exhaustively with this question, conceives the vitality
of living things, manifested in growth, development,
and reproduction, as lodged in what he calls
“Dominants.”<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> These dominants exist in all parts
of the organism, and govern those processes which
ordinary physical laws do not explain, <i>i.e.</i> the
phenomena which are specifically vital. They are not
themselves chemical or physical energies, but they
guide these energies toward the fulfilment of the
objects of life.</p>

<p class="quot">“Dominants,” he writes,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> “are those secondary<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> forces in
the organism whose existence we recognize in their operations,
but which we cannot further analyse. Thus I
understand under this form that principle of control which
takes effect in every organism and which sways whatever
energies are available just as men use tools and machines.
Since this control is manifold in its manifestations, one is
obliged, when seeking for a technical designation for it, to
express it in the plural. The dominants are therefore an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>abstraction; a symbol for phenomena, just like the conceptions,
Force, Matter, the Atom, etc.; the term has been
devised in order to provide a short explanatory description
of certain essential processes.</p>

<p>“I therefore repel the objection, if anyone should make
it, that the dominants are a fiction, a troop of ghosts with
which I have peopled the cells and organs of animals and
plants. They are, in some sense, merely a paraphrase of
the description of certain phenomena, a personification of
forces not to be ranged under the conception of energy—the
<i>directive</i> impulses in the animal and vegetable world.”</p>

<p>To continue Reinke’s explanation: Two different
classes of dominants are to be recognized. These are
the operative and the formative. The former control
principally the chemical activities of the organism, as
when a plant turns inorganic substances into sugar,
albumen, etc.; the latter are the invisible architects
in the organism who control its form and structure.
Both are heritable, and are capable of modification
within certain limits. Closely bound up with matter
and energy, they are neither matter nor energy.
They can be indefinitely multiplied and (to all
appearance) totally destroyed. Their multiplication
does not abstract energy from other known sources,
nor does their destruction restore it; they do not
therefore come (visibly) under the law of the conservation
of energy. They operate entirely within the
framework of natural laws, and can only utilize what
energies are available for them at the given time
and place. Every cell has its dominants; and as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
organism is a synthesis, not a mere aggregate, of
cells, so its individual dominant is a synthesis of the
dominants of its parts. The evolution of species,
like the development of an embryo, is under the
control of dominants. The conditions under which
they work for this end are material and physical;
these conditions can, to a great extent, be ascertained
and defined, but the driving force lies beyond scientific
analysis.</p>

<p>Such is the conception of Reinke; and taken as
he presents it, that is to say, merely as a kind
of working hypothesis, as a means of making intelligible
a vast and various mass of phenomena, it seems
admirably suited to its purpose. It remains to add,
though Reinke himself does not say so, that this
conception of the dominants appears to harmonize
remarkably with what has been put forward in
regard to cell-structure and reproduction. The chromosomes
are probably the material vehicles of the
dominants; in fact, Weismann’s determinants seem
to be the same thing under another name, though
Weismann conceives them rather from the point
of view of the scientist, and Reinke from that of the
metaphysician.</p>

<p class="tb">We have now arrived at an intellectual conception
under which to range the phenomena (not the
ultimate nature) of vital response. Let us apply it
to the question of evolution. The following passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
from Henslow’s <span class="smcap">Origin of Plant Structures</span><a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> may
serve to introduce this part of our discussion:—</p>

<p class="quot">“The question ... resolves itself into this: which
probability or hypothesis do <i>the facts</i> of the case seem to
favour most, viz. that <i>indefinite</i> variations arise from some
assumed internal causes, of which variations only those in
harmony with the environment survive, and are said, therefore,
metaphorically, to be selected by it; or is it that the
external forces of the environment excite the variability
which is inherent in plants, and call into action the
responsive power of the protoplasm in the various species
of plants, which thus <i>all</i> tend to put on the same, or
similar, or at least adaptive and <i>definite</i> variations of one
sort or another, so that there are <i>no</i> indiscriminate or
wasted variations<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> at all? I know an abundance of facts
which support the latter contention, but none whatever in
illustration of the former hypothesis.”</p>

<p>Here is the action of the dominants in evolution
placed in the clearest light. To prove the truth of
Professor Henslow’s contention it is necessary not
only to study organisms in situations where they
have been established for many generations or centuries,
but to see how they behave on transportation
to a new kind of environment. The cases which can
be adduced are numerous and convincing. Thus
Mr. D. Dewar reported to Mr. Henslow that on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>introducing at Kew a cress, <i>Arabis anachortica</i>, found
in cave-like situations in the Alps, and having very
thin, papery leaves, it turned, when raised from seed,
into a different species, <i>Arabis alpina</i>. The change
took only three generations to accomplish.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>Bulbous roots have it among their functions to
store up moisture for the plant they belong to.
Haeckel has shown that the grass <i>Poa bulbosa</i>, on
being cultivated in moist soil, almost lost its bulbous
character. Contrariwise we find that many plants
not bulbous elsewhere are observed to be so when
growing on the dry Karoo in South Africa.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>Spines on a plant are usual accompaniments of
dryness in soil or atmosphere. <i>Ononis spinosa</i> has
an excessively spiny variety, termed <i>horrida</i>, which
is found on maritime sands. Grown in very rich
moist situations, it gradually loses its spines and
they ultimately disappear entirely.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>In the animal world experimental cultivation is
not at all so easy, but the facts observed all go to
support the view that the response to environment
is direct and definite. The small shrimp-like crustacean,
<i>Artemia salina</i> is a case frequently quoted. It
lives in salt pools by the Black Sea, and it has been
found that by breeding it in water of which the
salinity is gradually decreased, the creature in a few
generations assumes a type commonly assigned not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>merely to a different species but to a different genus—<i>Branchipus
stagnalis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable instance of a transformation
produced by the influence of environment
is that of the Mexican water-newt, Axolotl. When
gradually accustomed to live on dry land, this creature
usually throws off its gills, develops lungs, alters
the shape of its tail, and takes on all the characteristics
of a terrestrial instead of an aquatic reptile. This
transformation does not take generations to accomplish—it
happens in one individual in the course of
a few weeks or months. When found in the terrestrial
form, the Axolotl is called <i>Amblystoma tigrinum</i>,
and is classed among the salamanders. Its progeny
are then <i>Amblystomas</i>, and they do not naturally
revert to the Axolotl type, although under certain
circumstances the steps of this amazing transformation
can be retraced. The Axolotl is not a larva in
the ordinary sense of the word, for it is not an imperfect
creature; it is sexually mature, and in most
cases, in nature, probably never develops into an
<i>Amblystoma</i>, nor do the progeny of the <i>Amblystomas</i>
begin as Axolotls. What we have here is probably,
as Weismann plausibly suggests, a case of a species
which has almost reached the stage of evolution from
an aquatic into a terrestrial form, so that a sufficient
impulse from its environment suffices to send it over
the border. Internal forces have evidently prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>the way for the change, and the process does not in
the least resemble the mechanical selection of suitable
characters from a crowd of fortuitous variations.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>The case of the Porto Santo rabbit may also be
quoted in this connexion. In the year 1419 the
young born of a tame Spanish rabbit were put ashore
on the island of Porto Santo near Madeira. No
rabbits then existed on the island. They have since
increased enormously, and have quite changed their
appearance. They have acquired a peculiar colour,
are very small, rat-like in shape, have nocturnal
habits, and are noted for their extreme wildness.
They no longer pair with the European rabbit. The
case was observed by Haeckel, who styled the new
species <i>Lepus Huxleyi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p class="tb">Cases like the foregoing show the organism affected
during its process of transformation by large
elemental influences, and the response to these influences
is so familiar that often it does not surprise
us. We veil the real mystery of the process by
talking of the chemical and other physical properties
of protoplasm which render this response possible.
But when we come to the protective mimicry of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>stinging insects by stingless ones, of leaves by butterflies,
and so forth, these physical explanations manifestly
fail us. The explanation which assumes the
building up of these extraordinary resemblances bit
by bit, through natural selection working upon a
multitude of fortuitous variations, fails us as completely.
It would be difficult to accept it if only a
single species of insect showed these mimetic markings.
The unlikelihood of their production by mere
chance in the case not of one but of hundreds of
species of butterflies, flies, and caterpillars is stupendous,
and defies all calculation. It must, we repeat,
always be borne in mind that, if chance variations
are all we can postulate, these variations must at first
be confined to one or few individuals, and that the
influence of intercrossing would always be at work
to obliterate individual peculiarities before they could
develop to the point of affording any protection
worth mentioning. We are bound, therefore, so far
as I can see, to conclude, first, that these mimetic
markings originate not in individuals but in the
species as a whole, and are an expression of the
communal life of the species; secondly, that they
are a real and direct response to the external conditions
of danger from attacks of birds, etc., and of
protection afforded by deceiving these foes through
mimicry of something which they do not care to
attack. They can only originate in the dominants
of the reproductive cells, and there, where undoubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>edly
forces and affinities of which we have no conception
are ever at work, the initial changes take
place. These changes, no doubt, take place by
forming new combinations or modifications of existing
dominants. The directive force must have something
to work on. It does not follow that because some
things are possible to it therefore all things are. It
is not to be expected, for instance, that human
beings, although it would be a great advantage to
them to fly, could ever develop wings, like the conventional
angels of mediæval art, for that would
violate the essential character of the archetypal form.
It is true, however, that life is ultimately responsible
for the material with which it works as well as the
directive agency that breathes through it. This point
is of importance and must be made perfectly clear.
The view of cosmic action here put forward does not
contemplate ‘interventions’ in the order of nature
from a source outside it. There never was a moment
when, if <i>law</i> prevailed, one result would take place,
while another result actually does occur in obedience
to some mysterious life-force. No; it is the life-impulse
which makes the law, obeys it and utilizes
it. One can never say, “Such and such would have
happened if the life-force had not been in action, but,
as it was, the event was so-and-so”; for if it were
not in action nothing would ever happen at all—the
Universe would be the Eternal Nothing. One might
as well speculate as to what would happen in a game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of whist if nobody held a trump. The voluntary
limitations under which nature works resemble, in
the conception here put forward, the playing of a
game, say a game of ‘Patience,’ where there is only
one player, who plays the game with himself. There
are laws to be obeyed, combinations which are necessary,
but a guiding force can take advantage of the
conditions as they arise and lead them to a certain
end. If there were no laws and conditions there
would be no game. If, on the other hand, matter
were absolutely plastic life could not realize itself;
nature’s game would be finished ere it was begun. A
concrete illustration may, while we are on this topic,
serve to suggest the kind of limitations under which
nature seems to work.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> During the last century or
so the African elephant has been ruthlessly hunted
down for its ivory, and since rifles and expanding
bullets came into play the process of extermination
has been greatly hastened. Elephants are now, I
believe, protected by law over a great part of South
Africa, but if it were not for this the species would
at present be in considerable danger of extinction.
The case is very like that of the <i>Kallima</i> butterfly
and similar mimetic forms before they acquired their
protective markings. Now, how might we expect
nature to attempt the protection of the elephant?
Doubtless by increased fleetness, cunning, watchfulness,
capacity of one kind or another for concealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>itself from hostile observation. But could we look
for any such development as, for example, a deterioration
in the quality of the ivory? Suppose, for example,
the interior structure of the tusk were to become
spongy and cellular instead of being dense. The
tusk, if coated with hard enamel, might be almost if
not quite as useful to the elephant, but it would cease
to be of any use for most of the purposes to which it
is now applied by man. The protection would be
most effective; yet we know that nothing of this
kind can possibly take place, though intrinsically the
process would be far less remarkable than the painting
of the butterfly’s wing. It cannot take place
because it would either imply a supernatural knowledge
on the part of the evolution-dominants of the
elephant tribe of the <i>reasons</i> why it is hunted, or a
conscious supervising and co-ordinating power above
nature, a manlike Deity, omnipotent and omniscient,
such as Paley assumed; to both of which explanations
the actual processes of nature stand uncompromisingly
opposed.</p>

<p class="tb">It is much easier to say what the life-impulse is
not than what it is. I cannot, for my own part,
conceive it as personal or conscious, in the sense in
which I feel myself a conscious person. If we ask,
Has it or has it not the quality of intelligence? we
shall find both the affirmative and the negative
answers equally hard to square with the facts. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
own intelligences working in a mysterious relation
to a bodily organism are perhaps fundamentally
incapable of forming a clear idea of the nature of
the cosmic intelligence which is revealed to us in the
outside world, “like the dim view of a country seen
in the twilight, with forms half extricated from the
darkness, with broken lines, and isolated masses.”<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>But those who find it difficult to believe that anything
having the nature of intelligence is at work
in the physical world might reflect on the striking
analogy which that world offers to a certain sphere
where it is quite certain that the human spirit, including
its intelligence as well as its appetites and instincts,
is the governing power. Social institutions are
a product of the human spirit. Yet the development
of these institutions is extraordinarily like that of
the functions and structures of an animal or vegetable
organism. The value of Mr. Herbert Spencer’s
philosophic system may be disputed on many points,
but his elaborate analysis of the phenomena of social
life and his exposition of the minute analogies they
exhibit to the processes of evolution in nature must
always remain a landmark indicating the conquest
of a great territory of human thought.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Here, as in
nature, we find a principle of movement and progress
conflicting with a principle of inertia. We
find all grades of development existing at the same
time. We see the gradual progression, by means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>of all kinds of by-ways, to a goal which one might
have expected intelligence to attain simply and
directly. We see parallels in human societies to
arteries, nerves, to co-ordinating and ruling brain-centres,
to the specialization of different members or
organs for different tasks; and we see all these things
growing up slowly, from point to point, in obedience
to immediate and pressing requirements. We find,
both in nature and in society, survivals of past structures,
whose use is gone, carried forward into new
stages of development. A particularly interesting
analogy is that of structures which develop to meet
one kind of requirement, and, on the cessation of
that, persist into a further stage and are then modified
to meet quite other requirements. Thus the
swim-bladder of the fish became, it is supposed, the
lung of the terrestrial animal. We may compare
this with the development of municipal institutions.
Originally intended to enable bodies of craftsmen
and merchants to make head against the aggressions
of a feudal aristocracy they have survived the
fall of feudalism, and have become more important
than ever as independent agencies for carrying on the
functions of social administration and education.</p>

<p>Thus, operations in the physical world which certainly
do not look as if they were the work of intelligence,
as we understand it, are seen to be closely
paralleled by transactions in the history of man’s
social life. The development of life, in fact, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
carried forward when the plane of human consciousness
is reached on just the same lines as those which
prevailed on the vegetable and the animal plane:
there is no breach of continuity in the broad outlines
of evolutionary progress. It is difficult to
over-estimate the significance of this fact.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing that man has evolved is so purely
a work of mind as Language. Here, the analogy with
the phenomena of physical evolution is very close
and very illuminating. As in nature, the ultimate
origins are obscure—we can only form hypotheses
as to how language came to arise from the cries of
animals, as we can only form hypotheses how life
arose from the play of molecular forces. But when
both are once established on the earth we see in them
the same general features—unity, in a few leading
types, branching out into infinite modifications in
subordinate groups. Greek, Erse, German, Russian,
Sanskrit are all Aryan tongues and have all a common
ancestry. They differ widely among each other, but
all alike are marked off from the Semitic or the
Mongolian families. So a man, a snake, a bear, a
fish are all vertebrates, and belong to a type essentially
distinct from that of a lobster or a snail. As
in nature, we find all stages of development existing
at the same time—some lines of development show
a rapid advance, some a very slow one. Some types
have, in both cases, perished completely—there are
fossil languages as there are fossil species. A new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
invention, an advance <i>per saltum</i>, without the utilization
of existing constituents, is almost as rare in the
evolution of language as in that of species. Just as
the lung is developed from the swim-bladder, so the
human mind, in the development of language, takes
hold of whatever existing form will suit its purpose
and transforms it to another end, as when it takes a
word for ‘breath’ and makes it ‘spirit.’ There are
laws governing the development of root-forms, linguistic
or physical, in various different orders or
species. The same osseous framework yields us in
one class of animal a hand, in another a hoof, in
another a paw, in another (as in bats) a wing. So in
language the same root yields us the words, in different
languages, for <i>shining</i>, <i>showing</i>, <i>speaking</i>, <i>proving</i>,
<i>a face</i>, <i>a story</i>, <i>whiteness</i>. Another gives us, <i>young</i>, a
<i>stepmother</i>, a certain <i>musical string</i>, a <i>messenger</i>.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
Contrariwise we see both in nature and in language
forms which have grown from entirely different roots
into a close external and functional similarity. What
unlearned observer would suspect that a whale was
not a fish, and that it descends from a furry land
animal with four legs, or that the Latin <i>Deus</i> and the
Greek <i>Theos</i> with their perfect identity of meaning
and their almost perfect identity of sound have
probably a widely divergent etymological pedigree?<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the etymological identity of such
words as <i>évêque</i> and <i>bishop</i> is as obscure on the surface
as would probably be the relationship of a greyhound
with a bull-dog to an anatomist who saw
them only in fossil form.</p>

<p>Again we note that languages, like species, when
they send out a migratory colony, are capable of
gradual transformation to meet new conditions, and
of marked divergence from the parent stock. Thus
English, as spoken and written in the United States,
in spite of the retaining influence of a common
literary tradition, is steadily diverging from the
English of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> So with the French of
Canada, the Spanish of South America, and the
Dutch of the Cape. We note also in both cases that
curious phenomenon, the survival of the useless relics
of earlier structure, e.g. in the silent letters which reveal
the historic origin of innumerable English words,
which are paralleled in nature by the vermiform
appendix of man, or the splint bones in a horse, or
the rudimentary legs of the whale or the python.</p>

<p>But analogies of detail like these, interesting as
they are, are not the main thing. The main thing is
the <i>organic likeness</i> prevailing between the work of
nature and this work of man—the likeness of growing
and developing structures, with their response to im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>mediate
needs, their development by specialization of
function, their lack of a strict logical scheme, their
anomalies and capricious variations, and their control
of these variations within certain archetypal forms.
The substance of language is sound, as the substance
of life is protoplasm. Phonetic laws govern the one
as mechanical and chemical laws do the other. But
phonetic laws and the capability of producing sound
could never have made a language. The evolution of
language is urged forward by the constant pressure
and expansion of human thought; and on human
thought, in its turn, it reacts, giving the stimulus and
the starting ground for fresh expansion. We have
the heart of the analogy before us now. <i>As thought
acts on language so the pressure and expansion of the
life-impulse acts on the forms of matter.</i> Let us see
whither the comparison leads us. Language is a
product of the human mind, but not of <i>a</i> mind. When
a human mind consciously applies itself to the fashioning
of a language it produces Esperanto. If we were
living in an Esperanto universe, such as Paley makes
out this to be, we might draw Paley’s easy conclusions
as to its Maker; but the reality is very unlike
that. On the other hand, if mind has produced the
natural languages which we see, with all their
anomalies, imperfections, and slow organic growth,
then the corresponding phenomena in nature, as the
evolution doctrine has brought them out, are evidently
no bar to the belief that mind has had a part in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
work also. I should go farther and say that the facts
compel a belief in the existence in nature of something
that can only be described in terms of mind.
In other words, the universe is, at bottom, rational.</p>

<p class="tb">It is true that the cosmic Reason acts not as a
single personal being, but more or less independently
at a multitude of points. But it must not be forgotten
that it is observed, up to a certain point, to act
through groups as well as through units. Even the
life and structure of a single cell show us distinct
parts acting in harmonious subordination to the
interests of the whole. An organism composed of
many of these cells exhibits a series of syntheses or
groupings rising in comprehensiveness and complexity
till the individual is complete and the wheel
of development has come full circle, beginning with
a single unit and ending with a complex unit. But
the synthetic movement of cosmic control does not
end there,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> for aggregates of individuals can be collectively
animated by it. The numerous cases of
co-operation among animals of the same species are
an instance of this. All animals which live in communities
exhibit this co-operation habitually, and
many others do so occasionally. When Professor
Eimer, as we have seen, reflected on the phenomena of
reproduction and heredity in ants and bees, he was
driven, like Oken, to account for them by regarding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>these creatures as “discontinuous organs” of one
being, having the same power of affecting each other
as have the distinct, though connected, parts of any
single animal or plant.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> As an illustrative analogy,
helping us to understand the invisible bond of the
communal life of a species, this conception is of
service, but I hardly think that we are in a position
at present to affirm it in any exact and literal sense.
Can we, however, trace the analogy, as Oken did,
beyond species, and show anything of the nature of
an adaptation of one order of beings to the use of
another? To do so convincingly, it is evident that
the adaptation must be of <i>no</i> use to the creature possessing
it; for, if it were, we might expect to see
it evolved, whether it were incidentally of use to
a neighbour species or not. Honey, for instance,
though apparently of no <i>direct</i> use to flowers, is
secreted by them because it attracts insects, and
insects fertilize the flowers. If flowers secreted honey
solely for insects’ use, deriving no benefit from their
visits, we should have a case of a synthesis of communal
life wider than that of the species. Are there
such cases, or does every species fight exclusively
for its own hand?</p>

<p class="quot">“If,” wrote Darwin, “it could be proved that any part
of the structure of any one species had been formed for
the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate
my theory, for such could not have been produced through
natural selection.”<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Certainly it could not, but neither could other
adaptations. Natural selection, as Darwin knew well
enough, does not “produce” anything—all it can do is
to depress the less favourable variations presented to
it in favour of the more favourable ones. As Darwin
never professed to have sounded the depths of the
problem of variation, it is not clear why variations
favourable to another species than the one in which
they occur should be presumed to be impossible. It
is true that they would not illustrate or come under
the operation of natural selection, but neither would
they contradict it—they would simply be outside it.
Individuals unquestionably exhibit modifications intended
not for their own personal benefit, but for
that of the species—for instance, the maternal instincts.
The modification of a part in the interest
of the whole to which it belongs may, perhaps, turn
out to have the same essential significance whether
the part is an organ or instinct belonging to the
synthesis called an individual, or an individual belonging
to the synthesis called a species, or a species
belonging to some fauna or flora of the globe. In
any case, the question where synthesis is arrested,
and where the fight for one’s own hand begins, is
one of great interest and must be here briefly discussed.
Cases such as those of which Darwin rejected
the possibility certainly appear to be rare,
if they exist at all. The naturalists of the older
school, of course, saw them everywhere—the rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>snake’s
rattle was to warn its victims, the colouring
of flowers was to give pleasure to man, and so forth.
Most of these cases have been exploded by modern
research. The modern naturalists, however, may not
be right in refusing to see them anywhere. The
question demands much special study and observation.
Reverting to the case of flowers and their
secretion of honey, one is struck by the fact that
in the <i>Viola</i> family there exist flowers more or less
conspicuous, and endowed with scent and with
honey-filled nectaries, which usually do not play
any part at all in fertilization. The process of
fertilization in <i>Viola</i> is carried on by small flowers
hidden under the leaves which never open, and
which fertilize themselves. Again, at the base of
the laurel leaf, on each side of the midrib, there are
two small glands filled with honey, and bees may
be observed biting into these in the early part of
the year before flower-honey is plentiful. Nägeli
has an ingenious argument to show the existence,
not exactly of disinterested aid among species, but
of something which would make such aid look more
possible than it does, of a mutual responsiveness,
namely, between the form of the honey-receptacles
of certain flowers and the probosces of the insects
which frequent them. Taking a short honey-tube
as the normal and original condition among plants,
and a short proboscis among insects, he argues
that the honey-tube could not have lengthened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
without depriving the species in which it did
so of the chances of insect-fertilization unless
the insect-proboscis in certain species lengthened
<i>simultaneously</i>.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Cases also have been noticed of
sea-anemones, which attach themselves to the shells
of hermit crabs and by their poisonous tentacles
repel attacks on the crab.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> The crab is no doubt
useful to its guest by providing it with the means
of locomotion. Still, the case of mutual help between
two such different orders of beings is remarkable.
A very peculiar case is that of the waterfern,
<i>Azolla</i>, which has certain roomy cavities on the
underside of its leaves. These are always found to
be occupied by a small unicellular organism of the
<i>Alga</i> order (<i>Anabæna</i>). It is of no apparent use to
the <i>Azolla</i>, which provides it a home. The arrangement
must have been of immensely long standing,
for it occurs in all the four species of <i>Azolla</i>, one
of which is found in America, two distributed over
Australia, Asia, and Africa, and one only in the Nile.
It must, therefore, have arisen before the original
species split into four.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>It would be rash to conclude from these and some
similar curiosities that we are really in the presence
of the phenomenon of disinterested aid given by one
species to another. The question needs more inves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>tigation.
But an important general consideration
arises in this connexion. It is clear that there could
be no advance in evolution if nature consisted solely
of a multitude of independent units of life, fiercely
competing against or warring with each other. It is
equally clear that no advance could take place if
every organism found an environment so perfectly
adapted to it as to call for the very minimum of
effort and strain in the maintenance of life. Between
the chaos of the first supposition and the lubberland
of the second there must be a condition of nature in
which synthetic organization is carried just to the
point at which life will have the maximum power
to perfect and to realize itself. Looking at the conditions
of nature as we know them, and at the majestic
expression of material and spiritual life which those
conditions have permitted, we may well be content
to believe that both the synthetic process, as far as
it goes, and its <i>apparent</i> suspension at a certain
point in the ascending scale, are the outcome of one
and the same motive and have one and the same significance—they
both alike mean and make for the conservation,
the development, the enrichment of life.</p>

<p class="tb">Against this view there is an argument which has
hitherto only been glanced at, but which must now
be discussed in more detail. It is represented in
a recent work by Prof. Conrad Günther, one of the
latest champions of the theory of chance variations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and natural selection as the sole explanation of
evolution, who has assembled a number of instances
to show that the “purposive force” which biologists
are now coming to believe in “often fails in living
beings.” Such are, for example, the fact that an
<i>Amœba</i> seeking nourishment will take in a particle
of stone or anything that comes in its way;<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> that
the mutual relations of flowers and insects are
often unsuitable; that a bee will sting a human
being just as it will another insect, although the
sting, only meant for the latter kind of use, cannot
be withdrawn from the human skin; that embryos
often go astray during development; that a cricket
which tries to escape in the open by burying itself in
the earth will act similarly if you set it on a glass
plate; and so forth. Nature, of course, teems with
such cases—one might add the singular degeneration
of the slave-making ants already described in some
detail.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> “If,” he concludes, “the purposive reaction
in the vital force of animals were independent of the
external world, they would be armed against all contingencies,
and that is not the case.”<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>Thus, too, Prof. Eimer, who in dealing with cases
where the alleged X factor in Nature has gone wrong,
writes:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>
<p class="quot">“The zoologist can hardly accept the existence of such
a dominant inner factor ever pushing toward advance, when
he recalls the host of regressive structures which he has
to see.”<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p class="tb">Now when the cause of physico-chemical <i>versus</i> vital
agencies comes to be tried, not in the laboratory but
in the study, not by science but by philosophy, the
first question that will be asked is, What, then, is
your distinction between ‘vital’ and ‘physico-chemical’
energies? How are we to recognize when
we are in presence of the one or of the other? The
usual answer to this searching question is that in
vital agency we find a directive, a purposeful, a
psychic element, whereas physico-chemical energies
seem to be nothing but the play of a blind, indifferent
mechanism. But, it will be rejoined, how can any one
affirm that physico-chemical energies are not also
vital, directive, psychic? Is there not, in fact, something
psychic in the very conception of energy? To
these questions there seems to me no conceivable
reply. When a ‘vital’ energy has been reduced to
a ‘physico-chemical,’ we have evidently explained
nothing—we have only exchanged one mystery for
another.</p>

<p>Yet if there is no difference in essential nature
between one kind of energy and another, there does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>appear a marked difference when we come to consider
them in relation to particular results of their
operation. Let us take an example. We explain
that classic instance of gravitation, the fall of an
apple, by reference to the law formulated by Newton
which extends to every particle of matter in the
visible universe. But we also find that the fall of the
apple is, for apples, a necessity of life; if the seed
did not fall to the ground when ripe there would
be no more apple trees. Yet gravitation acts quite
indifferently to the life of the apple. Whether the
branches overhang a river, or a street, or a plot of
fertile ground, the apple will fall straight towards
the centre of the earth. The fulfilment, therefore, of
the vital needs of the apple is plainly a by-product of
the force of gravitation. In this relation, gravity has
no directive or psychic element. Yet in larger relations,
we have to take note of the fact that if there
were no such thing as gravity, there would be no
apples and no earth. Thus the law of gravitation is
a condition of life as we now know it. The fact
that it acts mechanically, without selection or purpose,
in relation to particular occurrences is quite
consistent with the view that it, or the conditions of
the ether from which it possibly arises, may be directive
and psychic in relation to life as a whole, or rather to
what we recognize as the manifestation of life in the
material universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now got hold of a valid distinction between
mechanical and directive agencies. We can
distinguish them not by their nature but in relation
to the particular phenomenon we are considering.
We call them mechanical where that phenomenon is
a by-product of the agency, and directive where, if the
agency were conscious, we should say that this was
its main intent. I can see no more fundamental distinction.
It follows from this that the same action can
be at once both mechanical (physico-chemical) and
directive. The old distinction between vital and
mechanical energy disappears. The question resolves
itself simply into that of the number of distinct
agencies which are deemed necessary to account for
the universe.</p>

<p>Now the true way of dealing with this problem of
the unity or multiplicity of agencies in nature is, I
would suggest, to assume the existence of a single
power which is of course psychic and directive but
which can only be communicated to matter by
degrees and under certain conditions still very
obscure. These conditions it itself both creates and
uses. Its development in Time and that of matter
go on, as it were, on parallel paths, eternally apart (to
our limited view) yet eternally inseparable. The
key to the course of its development in nature lies in
the word Synthesis.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Here we seem to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>explanation of the apparent difference between the
so-called ‘vital’ and the physico-chemical forces.
When matter has been so grouped as to form not
a mere aggregate of particles but a synthesis, then
that synthesis is enabled to make use of energy in
a manner not open to its parts. Synthesis is a condition
of the discovery of liberation of unsuspected
forces. Thus a synthesis of molecules produces the
stage for Life, a synthesis of living particles produces
the Cell, a synthesis of cells produces an organism,
a synthesis of organisms is a species—for the evidence
(most notably that derived from the consideration of
bee and ant communities) seems to show that material
discontinuity in the members does not preclude the
existence of a true synthetic union.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The characteristic
power gained by a species is that of evolutionary
development working in the obscure region of
germinal combination and variation. Of course, I
am aware that all this is merely a way of representing
facts so as to make them intelligible to and
manageable by the mind. If any one should object
that we do not know what kind of grouping a
synthesis is, except precisely through that very
organic activity which I have described as its product
or accompaniment, I entirely agree. All these terms
are intellectual forms—like atoms, molecules, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>other concepts of physics. They do not reveal anything;
they merely help us to comprehend. In the
region of the controversy of Vitalism <i>versus</i> Mechanism,
the conceptions which I have been trying to
explain enable us, without introducing a multiplicity
of different energies, to understand how an organism
synthetized by life may exhibit directive action which
looks entirely different from any action possible in dead
matter. Yet it works under laws of its own, and no
doubt the particles of such an organism, if they were
conscious, would be unaware that any but physico-chemical
processes were in operation; in fact, I
should have no hesitation in agreeing with the statement
with which the great physiologist, Verworn,
concludes an exhaustive analysis of this obscure
subject: “The general fact must be regarded as
established, that all the work of the organism is
based finally upon chemical energy.”<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> But what
directs the chemical energy? Something which is
not itself a chemical energy and which is associated
with the organic synthesis which that energy
serves to maintain. Verworn’s statement, it must
be borne in mind, is as true of the composition
of the Iliad as it is of the digestive process of an
animalcule.</p>

<p>The explanations above suggested are purely
tentative; but so, it must be remembered, are the
theories which they combat. No one pretends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>that the mechanical explanation of the universe, including
the phenomena of organic life, is at present
made out so as to cover the known facts, or even that
expert opinion is at all unanimous in the belief that
it can ever do so.</p>

<p>I know no single work in which the present
position of the controversy is so well set forth as
in Professor V. L. Kellogg’s <span class="smcap">Darwinism To-day</span>.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> A
great array of scientific authorities will there be
found mustered, and the verdict of Professor Kellogg
(reluctantly given, for he clings to the mechanical
explanation of the universe) is that evolution is not
explained by any mechanical force at present known
to science. “With Osborn,” he concludes, “let us
join the believers in the unknown factors in evolution.”<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
He does not, however, contemplate their remaining
unknown—we have to say <i>Ignoramus</i>, not
<i>Ignorabimus</i>; and by ‘known’ he means apparently,
reducible to a mechanical process. He will have
nothing to say to any internal force directing the
energies of matter, such as the <i>Vervollkomnungsbewegung</i>
of Nägeli.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p class="quot">“Such an assumption,” he writes, “of a mystic, essentially
teleologic force, wholly independent of and dominating
all the physico-chemical forces and influences that we do
know, and the reactions and behaviour of living matter to
their influences which we are beginning to recognize and
understand with some clearness and fulness—such a surrender
of all our hardly won actual scientific knowledge
in favour of an unknown, unproved, mystic, vital force we
are not prepared to make.”<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>The above passage is very well fitted to be the
pivot of the whole controversy. We shall examine it
therefore in some detail.</p>

<p>It is, in the first place, hardly correct to say that
the <i>X</i> factor in life and evolution is supposed by
thinkers like Driesch, Reinke, and Nägeli to be
‘wholly independent of’ and to ‘dominate’ all the
physico-chemical forces that we do scientifically
know. Man, for example, cannot be said to be
‘wholly independent’ of the physico-chemical energies
of which he makes use for a multitude
of objects. He is very dependent, both on those
outside him and those in his own organism. He
cannot <i>originate</i> the smallest quantum of physical
energy. Yet he is unquestionably capable of directive
action upon matter.</p>

<p>In the second place it must be pointed out that
the <i>X</i> factor, conceived as it is in this book, though
Prof. Kellogg may call it ‘mystic’ if he likes, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>certainly anything but ‘unknown.’ There is nothing
more mystic than the human spirit—does not
mysticism mean the attribution of spiritual significance
to material things?—but there is nothing
more real and certain. The very act of knowing,
however material or mechanical may be the object
of knowledge, is an act of the spirit, and we know
the spirit itself better than anything else. How did
this spirit come into active being? There are only
two conceivable ways. Either it was at a certain
moment projected into the universe from without
by a Supreme Spirit, or it was, like everything else,
evolved. If we accept the former view we may say
good-bye to science. Miraculous interventions will
explain anything, and if we admit them in one case
they may be valid everywhere. But if we take the
second view, as do practically all men of science,
we are bound to admit that spirit had from the
beginning some constant and natural relation to
matter, for evolution does not work miracles—it
cannot make something out of nothing. If, then,
we regard Man not as an outside observer of the
universe but as an organic part of it—and I believe
no thinking about nature can be of any value until
we have grasped and fully realized that position—then
there can be nothing to surprise us if we find
traces of a directive control in the elementary processes
of life and development. It would be more
surprising if we did not. If we reduce the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
universe, apart from the human spirit, to physico-chemical
processes we are at once confronted with
the problem of evolving the human spirit out of
such processes; and that, on the face of it, is a
sheer impossibility. All physical and all chemical
phenomena as such are reducible to the movements
and groupings of atoms and molecules. These
movements and groupings can affect the spirit
which finds itself mysteriously implicated in their
activity, and the spirit can affect them. But that
molecular movements can <i>create</i> spirit is unthinkable
by any one who realizes what spirit is and what
movement. Rather should we say that in the power
of movement, in action, change of any kind, we are
to see the evidences of spirit.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to discuss the difficulty
raised by Eimer and by Günther, when they point to
instances where the supposed psychic force in nature
has failed to achieve its end. It fails because, on its
mechanical side, it sometimes encounters obstacles
which on the psychic side were not provided for.
The law of gravitation is a condition of life, but it
will kill a man who falls over a precipice. The
adaptability of protoplasm is a necessary condition of
evolution, but circumstances will occur in which the
adaptation means degeneracy for the organism as
a whole. Eimer’s argument is good, indeed, against
the mythological conception of a supreme Creator,
perfect in prescience and in power, who orders the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
goings-on of the universe from his throne above and
outside it. But we seek for no such being in natural
phenomena. Perfection is no attribute of anything
that operates in Time, and so far as we regard the
divine life as working in Time we must regard it as
becoming, not as being, perfect. Again, Eimer’s
objection shows that he conceives the psychic force
against which he is arguing as in itself something
mechanical, a mechanized kind of vitality, which
ought to achieve its end with a flawless exactitude.
Of this, also, nature knows nothing. The universe
is what it is precisely because the Power behind its
phenomena is neither blind Chance on the one hand
nor rigid determination on the other—because it is
vital, progressive, and free. This power is certainly
capable of making imperfect adaptations and of
diverging into false side-tracks of development.
That is a fact of much significance, but it is no argument
against the existence of such a power—it
merely reveals its character. A special study of
regressive structures and of the laws and principles
which lead to them would have extreme interest,
both for biology and for philosophy. But it could
not affect the significance of the broad fact that, in
a world where the highest living being was once
a particle of shapeless protoplasm, we have now
Man, a being lamentably unfit, indeed, to be the last
birth of Time, but uniquely great by his very consciousness
of that unfitness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>In contemplating this wonderful ascending movement
let us not forget that the warrant for its
continuance rests in ourselves. The false tracks,
the regressive forms, which meet us in nature prove
at least this: that the line of development which we
observe on earth may conceivably end in a disaster
which would bear to the course of Life in general just
such a relation as the degeneration of the Amazon
ants does to life on this globe. We are by no means
entitled to sit still and expect that the current of
evolution will bear mankind along irresistibly to its
goal. With the development of the conscious will
<i>we</i> are made responsible for the advance of life in
the only sphere which we know and which our
actions can affect. Man is, as it were, the growing-point
of that progressive life. If his strange passion
for the perfection which he has never seen should
be smothered in the struggle for mere existence, or
corrupted by brutal luxury, then growth will be at
an end, atrophy or degeneration will set in. The
vision of a nobler, freer, more humane life than is
anywhere widely possible on earth at present cannot
be realized without the strenuous help of men and
women who have learned to subdue the Ego with
its fierce egotisms into harmony with the purposes
of the divine Whole. But this much we may say—that
they will not fight alone. No one ever pursued
a high and worthy aim without finding that he
had drawn to himself those ‘great allies’ of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Wordsworth has written so greatly; powers implicit
in the nature of the world, and always waiting to be
unlocked by the heroic Will.</p>

<p class="tb">The Power, some of whose workings it has been
attempted to trace in the foregoing pages, is a controlling
and directive force, making, through countless
varieties of being, for one clear and definable
end—the realization of life. It may be asked, Are
we to regard this divine Power as wholly immanent
in matter or as partly transcending it and governing
it from without?</p>

<p>The nature of the divine principle, so far as we
are able to discern it, cannot be fully discussed until
we come to consider it in the highest sphere of
manifestation yet known to us, that of the human
soul. But with the question which has just been
raised we are now in some measure able to deal, and
the consideration of it may bring this section of our
study to a close.</p>

<p>In the world of inorganic matter, the tendency of
units to form themselves into groups having relation
to other groups is already visible. A force immanent
in the atom clearly becomes transcendent <i>in relation
to the atom</i> when atoms group themselves into
molecules. And when molecular affinities come into
play, and obey definite laws of form, as in the wonderful
phenomena of crystallization, we see that the
force immanent in each molecule becomes trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>cendent,
as regards the molecules taken separately,
when we look at them from the point of view of the
completed group. Crystallization is a process which
trembles on the very verge of vital action. And in
vital action the alternation of immanence and transcendence
in an ever-ascending scale becomes still
clearer and more significant. Every cell is a collection
of forces controlled by a power which transcends
each one of them, or any number of them below the
whole. Every cell colony, like the <i>Alga</i> described
in an earlier chapter,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> has a life which is immanent
in the colony but transcendent as regards its component
members. Definite groups of cells make up
the structure of the highly organized plant or animal,
and exhibit the same combination of forces immanent
in the parts and transcendent, as regards those
parts, in the whole. Again, each whole, each individual,
is moved by life-impulses immanent in itself
but transcendent in so far as they represent the communal
life of the species to which it belongs. This
communal life of the species becomes immanent again
when we regard it as embraced in the life of the
totality of beings on the globe. The thought must
at once occur, as the ascending series passes out of
reach of man’s intelligence: Whither, then, does it
lead us in the end? Is there any end? And is our
knowledge of Being absolutely limited to those parts
of it which lie <i>beneath</i> us?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>We are, I think, able, without going beyond the
limits of observation and experience, to frame a
synthesis of all physical nature, and to express its
character in terms of Life and Response. But at
the next step we have to embrace man with his
moral nature, his intelligence, his personal consciousness,
and there may for aught we know be beings far
higher than man who must also be included. Now
here we are not only <i>in</i> the synthesis and therefore
unable to grasp and survey it, but we are also quite
unaware of its contents and limits. We ask, Is the
All of Things personal? is It conscious? has It a
manlike intelligence? and so forth, and I confess
I see no way of answering these questions with our
present capacities. We can only say—but this is
much—that as the universe is one, the part of it
which we do not see cannot stand in any essential
contradiction to that which we do.</p>

<p>Furthermore we must remember that since, in that
aspect of us which observes and studies, we are distinct
personalities, we are obliged, in so observing
and studying, to regard things as outside of ourselves.
This is the core of the whole difficulty. At
bottom, the relativity of human knowledge does not
depend on the fact that time, space, and causality
are, as Kant has taught us, modes of thought imposed
upon our ‘I,’ with nothing external answering
to them; it goes deeper, it depends on the ultimate
fact that I <i>am</i> an ‘I,’ and <i>therefore</i> separate (as such)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
from what I observe, and <i>therefore</i> only capable of
studying my own states as affected by external
things, not the very things themselves. Real knowledge,
then, must consist in getting out of this prison
of ‘I’-hood and entering into actual union with
what we observe. Could we do that, we should at
once live not in our ‘selves’ but in the Whole. The
question then is, whether it is ever possible so to
escape, and how?</p>

<p>We must note, however, that no one who has done
this could ever tell us precisely what he has done.
For the moment he begins to put his experiences
into an intellectual form, the laws of the mind reassert
themselves, things externalize themselves
again, the ‘I’ reappears, the gulf yawns again between
subject and object.</p>

<p>And yet the instinctive language of man shows
that he does regard it as possible to <i>lose himself</i> in
the contemplation of something transcending his
powers of ordinary intellectual apprehension. Why
should he not? If a transcendent Reality exists, as
it must, then the faculty of entering into conscious
relation with it is one which Time would surely some
day bring to birth.</p>

<p>And although no man, as I have said, can ever express
to other minds in terms of the intellect the
reality he has thus witnessed, he has found means to
do better than this—he can help them to share his
vision. These means we call Poetry, Art, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Religion which is the poetry of Ethics. Through
these it is that man most truly lives, because united
in spirit with a larger life than his ‘self’ and his
senses are aware of. Through them it is that while
the eye sees the sunrise, the spirit sees the glory, that
while the intellect apprehends Truth, the soul is ready
to die for it, that while self-interest bands men together
in communities for mutual service, Love
prompts to the services that will never be recompensed.
We are not then, it seems, absolutely imprisoned
in our ‘I,’ strait as the bonds may seem.
But this must be added, that they will never seem so
strait as when we fancy that we can get out of them
by any purely intellectual conception of the Ultimate
Reality. “God,” says Æschylus most nobly, “is the
Air, God is the Earth, God is the Heavens; yea, God
is all things, and That which is above them.”<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> There
is always a ‘beyond’ for the explorations of the
intellect. The function of the intellect is to combine
and reduce to order the experiences of sense, thus
guiding us with definite aim through the bewildering
wonders of life. But let us not dream that it can
ever guide us to any goal or terminus. The goal
is at once infinitely distant and nearer than our
breath and blood. The search for it will last as long
as Time. It is of the essence of the view of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>universe here put forward that the intellect can never
embrace it in any closed system of thought. Turn
as we may to one after another of these closed systems
as each grows out of harmony with advancing
knowledge and insight, the true conclusion, at least
for readers who have followed these pages with
assent, will be to stand cheerfully ready to renounce
all systems, trusting in the last resort to no
formulas, but to the play of eternal Powers on the
imagination, the heart, the will:—</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE is, according to Mr. Herbert Spencer, a

<p>as much a helpless victim of external forces as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>are? Does the realm of natural <i>law</i> extend to
human actions and volitions; and if so, must it not
be an illusion to suppose that these can possess any
ethical quality whatever?</p>

<p>A great deal of the perplexity attaching to the
old problem, how to reconcile human free will with
divine predestination and omniscience, has, it seems
to me, been carried forward quite needlessly into the
new problem of the reconciliation of free will with the
reign of natural law. The problem in the old form
which occupied Milton’s rebel angels has scarcely
any meaning for modern thought. Human actions
are a part of the world of phenomena, existing in
time and space. When we think in that sphere of
things we conceive the Deity as the synthesis of all
things, and as the intellect can never arrive at
this synthesis, it follows that we can never represent
the Deity in terms of the intellect. An
infinitely wise, infinitely good and powerful Being
<i>has no definable relation to the phenomenal world at all</i>.
Therefore there can be no question either of reconcilement
or of opposition between the attributes of each.
God has not planned beforehand the course of the
world because (speaking in this sphere) God <i>is</i> the
world—past, present, and to come; and His being is
in process of completion by the world’s development.
In another sphere, behind the veils of space and
time, of causality and of sense, resides the Eternal
Beauty, the Eternal Wisdom, the Eternal Love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
approachable indeed by those who come to it “as
a little child,” but evading the questionings of the
intellect.</p>

<p>But the modern problem of Determinism and Free
Will has meaning enough for us all, without bringing
any transcendental relation into the question. Let
us state briefly the position of the Determinists. It
is held by them that every human thought—in fact,
every mental change whether of the nature of volition,
thought, or emotion—is a necessary effect of certain
antecedent causes, just like every change in the
material world. Every act of will is, on this view,
the mechanically accurate resultant of two forces:
(<i>a</i>) the particular nature of the man who wills; (<i>b</i>) the
circumstances which supplied the occasion for the
volition. It would seem to follow from this that no
man can be held morally accountable for his actions.
Were we sufficiently acquainted with his nature and
with the course of external circumstances, we could
predict his action throughout his whole lifetime as
surely as we can foretell an eclipse. He is what he
has been made by the circumstances of his life acting
on the whole mental and temperamental make-up
which he inherited from his parents. He does good
or ill as a tree bears good fruit or bad according
to its nature and to the treatment it has received.</p>

<p>The old theory of Free Will, which was content to
declare that each man’s choice in any ethical situation
presented to him by life was not imposed on him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the will of a Deity but was <i>his own</i> choice, thus
making him responsible to God and man for his acts,
evidently requires to be restated in view of the conception
of scientific Determinism just described, which
does not seek to impose on man the will of any other
personal being. But when we come to restate it, the
distinction between Free Will and Determinism appears
to be by no means so clear and intelligible as
it seemed at first sight. The essence of the Determinist
theory is simply that the same man will always,
under the same set of external circumstances, act in
exactly the same way. But how far does the advocate
of Free Will really deny this? Imagine a man
whom we regard as a type of honour and integrity,
a General Gordon, for instance, in the position of
being offered a bribe to betray a trust reposed in him.
We are quite assured that he would reject it, and
that he would reject it again and again to the end of
the chapter. So long as his mind and character remained
unchanged, his action would never vary. Was
his will therefore not free? And if so, how do we
distinguish its freedom from scientific Determinism?</p>

<p>We shall find that while the statement of the
Determinist position is quite easy and simple, the
statement of Free Will, the explanation of what we
really mean when we talk of the will being ‘free,’
is, when we look closely into it, a matter of much intricacy.
Believers in Free Will, says J. S. Mill in his
essay ‘On Social Freedom,’ are those who “believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in fact, that they themselves can, within certain limits,
do what they please.”<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> This is, indeed, the answer
which comes at once to the lips of the average man
when Socratically interrogated as to what he means
by Free Will. But the nature of the limits is just
the critical part of the question. I cannot fly because
I please. I cannot write a line of poetry because I
please. Can I live a saintly life because I please?
Perhaps not, it may be replied; but after all Free
Will does not essentially mean the external fact of
doing, it means the internal act of choosing—let us
substitute the word ‘choose’ for the word ‘do’ and
see what we arrive at. Very well, then; I can choose
what I please: let us try this formula. But at once
we perceive that this is a tautological expression, for
what I ‘please’ to do is simply what I choose. So
the formula is finally stripped to this bare expression,
‘I can choose.’ But now the Determinist will say,
‘Who denies it?’ The psychological process known
as ‘choosing’ is within every one’s experience. The
question as to what governs the choice remains untouched.
The core of the problem, then, has been
found to lie not in the word ‘do,’ not in the word
‘please,’ not in the word ‘choose.’ Where is it
then? It is not in ‘can,’ for ‘I can choose’ adds
nothing philosophically to the contents of ‘I choose.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<p><i>The core of the problem is the word ‘I.’</i> And until
we have settled what ‘I’ am, we shall not reach
a clear issue between Free Will and Determinism.</p>

<p>So the test which we have applied to human
actions with a view to finding out whether they conform
to law as do physical phenomena or not—the
test, namely, whether they always come out the same
under the same circumstances or not—breaks down.
The ‘circumstances’ include the man himself, and
the question ‘What is a man?’ turns out to be the
real point at issue.</p>

<p>The Determinist usually belongs to a school which
has a clear and simple answer to this question. Man,
for him, is a complex of vessels, nerves, ganglia, and
molecular configurations of brain matter responding
to external stimuli as uniformly and inevitably as a
plant. Consciousness is merely a sort of by-product
of this mechanism, which would go on just the same
without it.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>But this view is in direct contradiction to the deepest
and clearest deliverance of human consciousness,
which affirms that I am a deliberative and ruling
Mind, and bids me regard my Will as Reason in
action. I seem to know this so intimately and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>foundly
that if it is an illusion there appears to be
nothing else in the world of which I can ever venture
to feel sure. We know the outside world only at two
removes. The external object has first to impress
itself in some as yet unexplained manner on our
physical organism, and the latter has then in a manner
equally mysterious to produce a state of consciousness
in the observer. But consciousness, in Man, can
turn upon and interrogate itself; it is subject and
object in one; and its deliverances, so far as they go,
so far as they are pure deliverances of consciousness
with no argumentative deduction subtly mingled with
them, are the truest things we know or ever can
know. I do not see how they can possibly be brought
to the test by any other kind of knowledge: <i>they</i> are
the test of everything.</p>

<p>We find, then, that when we talk of ‘free’ choice
as the prerogative of man what we mean at bottom
is the choice of a self-determining Mind. We find,
also, that while for every event in the physical world
we are obliged to assume an antecedent cause, we
are under no such obligation as regards Mind.
When we have traced any sequence of causes and
effects up to a Mind, we require to go no further.
We can conceive a self-determining Mind. If man
is such, or so far as he is such, his will is what we
call free.</p>

<p>But to say that we are profoundly conscious of the
existence of our will does not by any means get rid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of the difficulties connected with this belief, and it is
incumbent on us either to attempt a solution of
them or frankly to dismiss them as, for the present,
insoluble.</p>

<p class="tb">If possible, to begin with, we must obtain a clear
idea of the difference of the will from other forms of
vital action.</p>

<p>At one end of the ascending scale of organic life
we see an animalcule swimming in the direction in
which it is attracted by food. At the other end, we
find a man in the full flush of conscious life going
deliberately to a shocking death rather than deny his
faith or break a trust. What is the essential difference
between the action of the animalcule and that of
the martyr? To the Determinist there is none.
Both are alike the inevitable response to certain
stimuli from the outside world acting on a certain
nervous system. But there is one difference in the
<i>circumstances</i> of the action which will be admitted by
all. The animalcule has no <i>choice</i>. The martyr has.
The animalcule-consciousness has not been developed
to the point at which it can take in alternative courses
of action and compare them with one another. It is
doubtful to me whether any of the lower animals or
even of the lower races of man can really do this.
At any rate there can clearly be no Will where there
is no distinct consciousness of at least two possible
courses of action. The Will, therefore, must be re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>garded
as coming for the first time into action when a
certain stage in the development of consciousness has
been reached, the stage at which man is fully conscious
of more than one motive. Furthermore, even when
the consciousness has been developed to this point
we cannot recognize a true act of will unless, <i>on that
particular occasion</i>, two or more motives were fully
present. For instance, a lad brought up in a thieves’
kitchen, when he sees an opportunity for stealing a
purse, cannot properly be said to have any counter-motive
to the theft. And common sense, without
having philosophically analyzed the matter, quite
recognizes this position of affairs and graduates the
moral responsibility of every criminal action roughly
in accordance with the facilities which the subject has
had for ‘knowing better.’</p>

<p>Two or more motives, then, fully present to consciousness,
form the conditions under which alone the
Will can be said to act. This is in accord with the
whole scheme of evolution. The presence of certain
conditions gradually evokes the faculty or organ
which deals with them. But here an important question
arises. When these motives differ from each
other morally, can the Will be said ever to choose the
evil one? Has it any moral bent? And if not,
what is the use of it?</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the ascription to the Will of
a certain moral character, and that a very lofty one,
is characteristic of nearly all thinkers who accept its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
existence at all. “Ill for him,” writes Tennyson in
lines of Sophoclean dignity,</p>

<p class="center f85">“Who, bettering not with time<br />
Corrupts the strength of heaven-descended Will,”</p>

<p>as though evil came from the corruption and slackness
of Will, not from its wrong direction.</p>

<p>In the ethics of Plato it was a cardinal principle
that men did evil only through ignorance. Make the
soul conscious of goodness, and it could not fail to
follow it. Yet it seems that this doctrine, strongly as
it appeals to the moral sense of man, would, if held
with philosophic rigour, really make the Will unfree.
No man can truly choose the good who is unable to
choose the evil. The Platonic doctrine may, however,
be fully accounted for, and even put in a form
in which it can, to a great extent, be justified, if we
give weight to the following considerations. Moral
action is usually recognized in the renunciation of a
strong personal gratification for the sake of some
social or other altruistic end. Now in such cases we
are always sure that the two motives have been duly
present, the moral motive, for otherwise it would not
have been followed, and the personal motive, for these
are common to all living things, they are at the base
of our being, and our own experience tells us only too
well how insistent and powerful such motives are.
The volitional character of such an act is therefore
manifest. But if the lower motive be followed, the
significance of the event is more obscure. For we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
understand these lower motives,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and they are fairly
uniform over the whole of humanity. We can always
take for granted that they are present in full force.
The martyr undoubtedly hates the idea of being
burnt. But we are not so sure of the other class of
motives. We cannot in every case feel certain (unless
the event has verified it) that <i>they</i> were distinctly in
view, for man’s moral nature is still only at the beginning
of its development, we are still far from having
evolved anything like a universal moral code, not
to speak of the instincts for obeying it. We are
inclined to assume, therefore, and I think we are
perfectly right in assuming, that when the Will appears
in human action it is far more often to good
purpose than to evil. In order that it may be free
to act on any ethical question, there must be a sufficient
degree of ethical development; the character
of moral worth must have been impressed upon the
spirit. In the strength and stay which it affords to
such a spirit, the faculty of Will is most clearly
recognized and honoured.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to meet one of the
gravest of the objections which have been brought
against the doctrine of Free Will. If temperament
and circumstance, it is urged, determine human
action, there is, of course, no place for the Will—it
is a mere illusion. But if Will is present and is su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>preme,
how can temperament and circumstance play
the part they manifestly do—how does the history
of man come to present, as we have seen, an aspect
so strikingly similar to that of the orderly evolution
of physical organisms under natural law? If you
bring in Will at all as an arbiter of human action, do
you not thereby drive out everything else?</p>

<p>The answer will be clear to those who accept the
foregoing analysis of the elements of choice. The
Will is neither a faculty of perception nor a faculty
of judgment, but a power of free choice. Free as it
is, <i>it can only act on what is presented to it</i>; and here,
beyond question, it is subject to serious limitations.
Every man has round his soul, as it were, a refracting
medium, through which the external objects that
excite the Will to action must normally pass before
they reach the centres of decision and control. And
this medium is probably never quite the same in any
two individuals. Often it is very widely different.
The sight of an unguarded heap of treasure may
appear to one man simply in the aspect of a perfectly
legitimate opportunity for enriching himself. To
another man it may come as a violent temptation to
do what he knows in his soul to be wrong. A third,
equally needy, equally capable of enjoying all that
wealth represents, may never have a thought on the
subject except that of protecting the treasure for its
true owner. The object is the same, the physical
perception of it is the same, but the ‘apperception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>’
in each case is as different as Peter Bell’s perception
of the “primrose by the river’s brim” was from that
of Wordsworth. This difference is caused by the
modifying influence of temperament, training, all
that forms a man’s disposition, whether acquired or
inherited. It is as though each man moved in an
atmosphere, an <i>aura</i> of his own which colours all
the objects of his thought. Whether <i>every</i> invitation
to action that can be presented to the Will must
necessarily pass through this <i>aura</i> is a very obscure
question and one on which I do not at present wish
to dogmatize. But it is certain that the great majority
pass through it.</p>

<p>Thus on every occasion where the Will is exercised,
it has to act not only on the facts which are perceived
but <i>as</i> they are perceived. Now so far as the influence
of what is called apperception is concerned we
are in the realm of natural law. Each man, to that
extent, is unquestionably under the dominion of his
environment, that is to say of geographic, historic,
social, and other influences which affect whole
communities, and which vary but slowly when
they vary at all. The Will, in fact, acts within
the framework of nature and its laws exactly as
does that directive agency to which, in the view
of the writer, is to be attributed the phenomenon
of progressive evolution from lower forms of life to
higher forms, that is, from forms which admit of
less life to those which admit of more. The Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
is really this directive agency coming into consciousness
in Mind.</p>

<p>In all life, whether human, animal, or material,
there is an element of change and an element of
constancy. Between these poles it moves and has
its being, nor could life, as we know it, exist for a
moment if either of these two opposing but complementary
principles were withdrawn. We have
now seen that with a full belief in the innovating and
incalculable quality of the Will, with the infinite
vistas which that belief opens up to human hope and
effort, there is yet ample room for the opposing and
equally necessary element in life, the element of
constancy, uniformity, law. Human Will does not
come into nature as a catastrophic force—it develops
<i>pari passu</i> with the development of consciousness;
and it will naturally be found in its highest development
where the whole nature is most wholesomely
attuned to the purposes of the cosmic Will.</p>

<p class="tb">We have now to notice certain grave objections
which every student of modern science and philosophy
will expect to see dealt with by a defender of
the principle of Free Will.</p>

<p>It has been objected from the evolutionist standpoint
that, as no one attributes Free Will to the lower
forms of animal life, it is impossible to conceive it as
having arisen in man except by a miracle. At what
point, it is asked, did it first appear? And if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
cannot fix the point, the presumption is supposed to
be that it has never appeared at all. It will be
remembered that some scientific thinkers such as Mr.
A. R. Wallace, and one may add Prof. Reinke, have
been so much impressed by the mental difference
between man and the beasts that they have assumed
the gulf to have been bridged by a catastrophic or
miraculous act and not by any evolutionary process.</p>

<p>Now I quite admit that one cannot conceive mind
being evolved from not-mind. But neither can I
conceive life being evolved from not-life, nor, in fact,
when one looks into the process minutely, can I
believe in anything whatever, physical or spiritual,
turning into something else. I conceive the evolutionary
process strictly as the ‘unfolding’ of latent
capacities, faculties, organs, by means of psychic
agencies acting within the framework of the fixed
relations which we call natural law. The fact that
one cannot lay one’s finger on the exact point in the
history of nature where mind and will began to be is
not relevant to the question whether they are now present
or not. As well might one be challenged to fix the
moment when the embryo becomes a man. There
are <i>no</i> such exact points in nature. If there were,
nature would be discontinuous, and the smallest real
discontinuity in nature would be enough to shatter
the frame of the universe.</p>

<p>From another side it has been urged that the conception
of the continuity or oneness of the universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
is fatal to Free Will. The Monist, according to that
brilliant champion of chaos, Mr. William James,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> must
believe in a universe fixed like cast-iron in all its parts,
for, being all interrelated, not one of them can be
different without altering the whole structure of
things.</p>

<p>But does not Mr. James here overlook the fact that
essential oneness is not incompatible with temporal
incompleteness? The universe is one, true—but this
one universe comprises not only all that has been
and that is, but all that will be. It is to be conceived
at present as a growing organism; it will not be a
fixed and completed whole till time is at an end. On
this basis I see no difficulty in fitting into a Monistic
scheme of thought Mr. James’s admirable statement
of the Free Will position:—</p>

<p class="quot">“Our acts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves
to make ourselves and grow, are the parts of the world to
which we are closest, the parts of which our knowledge is
most intimate and complete. Why should we not take
them at their face-value? Why may they not be the actual
turning-places and growing-places <i>of the world</i>—why not the
workshop of being where we catch <i>fact</i> in the making?”<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>The next and last objection I propose to deal with
cuts closer to the heart of the question and will have
to occupy us, I hope not unfruitfully, for some time.</p>

<p>I instanced some time ago the case of martyrdom
as one in which every one would recognize the action
of the Will, if it can be recognized anywhere. Let me
recall that extremest form of martyrdom which John
Stuart Mill once declared himself ready to face rather
than outrage his moral sense. Speaking in his
<span class="smcap">Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy</span>
of what passed in his day for the ‘orthodox’ conception
of the Supreme Being he wrote:—</p>

<p class="quot">“Whatever power such a being may have over me, there
is one thing which he shall not do: he shall not compel me
to worship him. I will call no being good, who is not what
I mean when I apply that epithet to my fellow creatures;
and if such a being can sentence me to hell for not so
calling him, to hell I will go.”<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>Mill, as we see, relied on his personal freedom of
Will to stiffen his neck against any homage to a
Power whom his moral sense declared unworthy of
reverence. But a modern physiologist would tell him—and
even if the fact be not fully demonstrated at
present, it would, I think, be very rash for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>psychologist to deny it—that by a slight change in
the molecular configuration of the brain cells the
heroic recusant could have been turned into a devout
worshipper of any being who was able to exhibit the
credentials of superior force. Such a change would
certainly not be beyond the powers of a being who
had heaven and hell at his disposal; even a skilful
surgeon might accomplish it. What, then, is the
freedom of the Will worth (it may be asked) if the
direction it takes is at the mercy of the physical configuration
of our brain-matter? And the ‘I’ which,
we say, wills—if material changes can thus profoundly
alter its character, how can we attribute to it any kind
of real and independent existence? Must not the
complete dispersal of the molecules of the brain at
death cause the ‘I’ to vanish altogether like a
blown-out flame? Must it not be at their mercy
during the brief illusion of existence?</p>

<p>Our discussion has thus plunged us into the intricate
question of the relations of mind and matter,
and we must pause to dwell on it for a while.</p>

<p>What is matter? Nobody can tell. It is that
which resists when we push against it—a tactile or
muscular sensation. It is that of which two portions
cannot occupy the same space at the same time—a
visual sensation. It is the source of certain sensations;
and the most recent physical investigations
points to its being composed of innumerable centres
of <i>force</i>. But force manifesting itself in orderly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
harmonious fashion is Reason. If, then, Reason is
at the base of things, Matter ceases to be a bogey.</p>

<p>Still the fact remains that it is not I and it is
not You, and the real cogency of the physiological
argument against Free Will and the soul (which, as
we saw, must stand or fall together) is that something
done, perhaps by mere accident, to this Not-me,
can, it appears, powerfully influence and change
the Me in spite of all the will I can exert to the
contrary. The fact that I, the innermost I, can be
got at through my brain, means philosophically
exactly the same as the old superstition according
to which I can be got at by an enemy who sticks
a waxen image of me full of pins and dissolves it
before a fire. And <i>normally</i> (there seem to me good
reasons for not going further than that), <i>normally</i>,
it is <i>only</i> through Matter that the Me can be reached
and influenced at all, even by the other Me’s in the
universe. Now Matter, whatever else we may say
about it, is certainly under the law of causation.</p>

<p>From the other, the spiritualistic, side of the argument,
it has been sought to meet the above considerations
by an interesting analogy. Matter (the
brain in this case) may, it is urged, be regarded as
the instrument by which, under present conditions,
Thought manifests itself and acts. You can take
a piano and put it out of tune or otherwise damage
it, so as to render it incapable of conveying the real
mind of the performer, who, nevertheless, remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
quite unaffected. The soul is the invisible performer.
You can damage the brain so that the soul <i>can no
longer express itself</i> under the conditions of our present
existence, but it is an entirely unwarrantable
inference to say that you have thereby damaged or
destroyed the soul itself. The analogy of physical
energy will make this clear. You can make an
engine work by the oxidization of coal, but this
process can only loosely be described as the source
of the energy which is manifested by the engine.
All that one does by burning the coal is to turn
potential energy into active or kinetic energy. When
the engine goes to pieces, or the coal burns out, not
a particle of energy is lost; it merely goes back
into the shape of potential energy again.</p>

<p>I think this reply is substantially a sound and
effective one. At the same time it must be allowed
that the physiological argument is more subtle than
is usually recognized by those who try to meet it
as above. You may so damage a piano as to render
it incapable of being properly played on—you may
get from it the incoherent janglings of insanity, without
affecting our belief in the existence of a real
musician behind these unintelligible manifestations.
But how if it can be shown that certain mechanical
alterations will result, not in nonsense but, let us say,
in bringing out mere Offenbach when the performer
has always hitherto been wont to play Beethoven?
A simple injury to the instrument, it may justly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
argued, has no such vital significance as this change
in the nature of the thing expressed. Shall we not
have to conclude that the man really <i>is</i> the instrument,
that the mind is a phenomenon accompanying
the temporary combination of certain material constituents,
lasting only as long as that combination
shall endure and varying <i>pro tanto</i> with everything
that causes it to vary?</p>

<p>Now, for my own part, I must confess that if mind
with all its nobler manifestations such as Will, Love,
Duty, and so forth, be a mere rainbow hovering
above the cataract of material force, it does not seem
to me worth while to discuss anything, for we, mere
particles that glimmer for a moment, can never affect
anything, and must soon be where nothing can any
longer affect us. It is happily quite true as Santayana
says in his <span class="smcap">Reason in Science</span>,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> that people
who do not think about these matters at all may
“know how to live cheerily and virtuously for life’s
own sake” on the strength of the normal source of
vitality which has made for its own ends from the
beginning of things without the aid of our consciousness
or criticism. But this consciousness,
turning inward as well as outward, this questioning
and speculative spirit, are themselves forms of
vitality, phases in the gradual conquest of Nothingness
(<i>i.e.</i> undifferentiated Being) by Life. We stunt
and maim ourselves if we try to keep them aloof. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>is true that in encouraging them we may often seem
to be turning the terrible, two-edged weapon of
Analysis against our own higher life. Be it so!
We have taken that sword in hand; we have cut
down with it a hundred forms of superstition and
wrong; and the time to sheath it is not yet. Whatever
dangers there may be in it, we must face those
dangers; and though it may be left to another
generation completely to overcome them, let that
generation, at least, say of us that we did not drop
our weapons on the field of battle, even if our own
life-blood sometimes flowed upon the blade.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<p>Let us now return to that analogy of the piano
and the unseen player and see if we can get some
more light from it than has yet appeared. In view
of the last considerations which were urged in this
connexion—the possibility of effecting not merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>the ruin of the instrument but the more vital change
of the character of the music it will perform, we
must slightly alter one of the terms of the comparison.
The analogy will be a strikingly close and
suggestive one if we bring into view the latest
development in musical mechanism, the pianola.
Suppose that the music-rolls of a pianola were
made of different sizes and shapes according to the
different classes of music. There would then, let us
say, be one kind of roll for classical music, another
for Italian opera, another for Palestrinian polyphony,
another for music-hall ditties, and subvarieties of all
these. Now let us suppose that each pianola were
so constructed as to take some particular type of
music easily, other types with more difficulty, and
others, again, not at all, and let us assume that all
these types are continually being presented for performance.
The construction of the pianola will then
correspond to the physical constitution of the brain.
This constitution, in each case, is the material equivalent
of the dominance of a particular kind of personality,
or what we have called above <i>aura</i>. But
the records which have lately been so much studied
of cases of what is called ‘multiple personality’ tend
to show that in each of us there <i>are</i> several distinct
personalities—or if that word seems to beg an important
question as to the unitary character of personality,
let us say streams of consciousness—which
are pressing for manifestation. The brain selects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
automatically among these, and normally keeps one
particular type to the front. But just as a mechanical
alteration in our hypothetical pianola might entirely
change the type of music it would play, so a lesion
or shock of any kind might change, more or less, the
type of personality which a particular brain was fitted
to express; and such cases are, of course, well known
to occur.</p>

<p>But now we come to a fact than which none is
better known, none more absolutely verifiable in
experience, but to which there is nothing in the least
analogous in the pianola or any other piece of
mechanism taken by itself. I can, with time and
toil, with patience and resolution, <i>change the structure
of my brain</i> and make easy for it that which before
was difficult or impossible. Within limits which
cannot be defined (because human life is too short),
I can even adapt it to the expression of a new type
of personality. No musical instrument can do that
to itself. One would have to call in for that purpose
the initiating and controlling force of the man who
made it.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>
<p>A conscious pianola, even if we supposed it to
possess the endowment of memory, would only recognize
itself as a succession of sensations. The hegemonic
faculty, the sense of command and control,
which Plato<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> laid his finger on, as indicating the
difference between a human personality and a musical
mechanism, and which Hermann Lotze,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> in the full
light of modern science, still thought valid for the
same purpose, would be wanting. Man does not
live in the moment. As Goethe wrote in some of
his greatest lines—lines that read like hammer-strokes
nailing up the charter of human right:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Nur allein der Mensch</div>
<div class="line">Vermag das Unmögliche;</div>
<div class="line">Er unterscheidet,</div>
<div class="line">Wählet und richtet;</div>
<div class="line">Er kann dem Augenblick</div>
<div class="line">Dauer verleihn.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Behind the mechanism of the pianola, behind the
mechanism of the brain, there stands this living directive
force of which we can give no scientific account
whatever—we can only say that it is there. Indeed,
it is just at this point that all comparison between
mechanism, as usually understood, and vital action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>of any kind must break down. But the fact is that
mechanism is usually not understood at all. I
spoke above of a piece of mechanism taken by
itself. But in truth we cannot take it by itself.
Nothing in nature can be truly isolated, it only
exists in relation to other things. Every machine
has a soul, the soul of the man who made or who
works it. Without that it would be merely scrap-iron;
and even as scrap-iron it has relations with things
about it—air, water, acids, and the like. In these
relations we detect the soul of nature. Nothing
exists by itself—nor even, permanently, <i>as</i> itself.
The living universe of our experience is not a Being
but an Acting and a Becoming. It is precisely this
fact which, on the one hand, imposes a mysterious
limit on the intellect, and, on the other, opens a
boundless horizon before the will.</p>

<p class="tb">The human brain, the most highly organized form
of protoplasm known to us, may be called in one sense
a machine through which the personal will, the moral
emotions, the æsthetic sense, the faculties of reasoning,
have to assert themselves in action. But to say
that they would never have existed but for this special
form of protoplasm is to say that they were created
by it out of nothing. And, no doubt, one can say
that, one can <i>say</i> anything; but one cannot think it.
I do not see how to represent the matter to our
thought except by supposing that every stage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
physical evolution is accompanied by what has been
called ‘involution,’ a drawing in, from the potentialities
of Being, of powers and faculties of living
for which the opportunity to become actual had
ripened.</p>

<p>An image may make clearer what I mean, and I
offer it only for this purpose, well knowing that “the
best in this kind are but shadows.” Suppose that a
man were enclosed in a sheath composed of metal
having certain peculiar properties: it is opaque when
cold, but when heated it becomes transparent, and
the hotter it is the more transparent it grows. Such
a substance might easily exist, at any rate it is entirely
conceivable. We must assume in addition that
the heat is not such as to be injurious to the occupant.
Now a man enclosed in such a sheath would,
when it was at the proper temperature, see what was
going on around him; he could also be seen, he
could hold communication with other men, and
direct operations which he wished carried out. If
the sheath, in addition to being transparent at the
right temperature, were also, under the same conditions,
flexible, and fitted him like a skin, he could do
things himself. If it got cold, however, and thereby
became, in the measure of its coolness, opaque and
rigid, the man would be shut off from all communication
or interaction with the world outside, he would
be what we call dead.</p>

<p>I suggest that Consciousness with all its attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
phenomena is represented by the man, the sheath is
Matter, the heat is Life. Matter, historically, precedes
the manifestation of consciousness, but as it is
never without a certain degree of life, so, even in the
nebular form in which it exists before it has cohered
into worlds and systems, it is not without the element
of directivity, of harmonious inter-relation and interaction.
A higher organization of life makes possible
the subtler sensitiveness of the vegetable kingdom.
The most vital, the most highly organized form of
matter we know is the human brain and nervous
system. Here the sheath has assumed a considerable
degree of transparency and flexibility. But
doubtless a far higher degree of organization is possible,
and when this is reached the capacities of consciousness
will have developed to an extent altogether
inconceivable to us at present, though every now and
then some exceptionally constituted individual gives
us a hint of stages of development as yet far beyond
the capacities of the race in general.</p>

<p>We may conceive matter, then, as being constantly
fanned up into the heat of life, <i>i.e.</i> as elaborating
forms into which consciousness can enter and through
which it can act. And we observe that consciousness,
when it has found a suitable form, can act on it and
improve it. Two questions now arise. The first is:
Why should consciousness have need of these forms
at all? And the second is: If it has this need, what
becomes of the individual consciousness when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
form has grown finally cold in death and is resolved
into its inorganic elements?</p>

<p>To the first question I cannot suggest any answer,
except the obvious one that an individual consciousness
must have some forms through which it can
have relations with things not itself. In the world,
as we have it, it is <i>generally</i> true—it would be unwise
to venture any absolute statement on the subject—that
consciousness only enters into relation with
another consciousness, or with matter, by means of
the peculiarly organized form of matter which we call
a brain. I must leave the question there. Thought
and research, and the advance in physical organization
which I have referred to, may, in the near or distant
future, throw further light upon it. It is not a difficulty,
but it is certainly a mystery.</p>

<p>As regards the second question, that of personal
immortality, all we are justified in concluding on the
negative side is that when a certain body and brain
have perished, consciousness can express itself
through <i>that</i> form no more. But consciousness
itself cannot be less indestructible than everything
else that exists. We may, so far as I can see,
either conceive an individual consciousness at death
as being resolved into the general consciousness from
which it sprang, even as the matter composing any
organic being is resolved into inorganic matter, or we
may suppose that, having won and consolidated its
selfhood by what it has done and what it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
endured in the flesh, the selfhood is thenceforth
capable of an independent existence under forms at
present beyond our ken.</p>

<p>Either of these conceptions implies what we call
the ‘immortality’ of the soul, the real and permanent
significance of the experiences of the soul. Here
a little further elucidation may be desirable. I have
spoken of the possibility of the soul or self being
resolved into something which one can only describe
as a general spiritual substance related to individual
souls as matter in general is related to particular
material organisms. But the parallel with matter
must not be pushed too far. A material organism,
being composed of different substances, can be disintegrated.
But consciousness cannot, strictly speaking,
suffer disintegration, for it has no different substances
into which to disintegrate. It can, however,
as we see, appear in the form of a number of different
personalities; and this, the normal existing condition,
is the psychical analogue to physical disintegration.
If these personalities are again to merge into one
impersonal consciousness, the process would not be
comparable to disintegration; it would be the very
reverse; it would be reintegration; and the process,
therefore, implies nothing resembling the loss or dissipation
of any form of psychic being.</p>

<p>Further, we have to observe that when a material
organism perishes and is disintegrated, there is, so far
as we can see, an utter and complete end of it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
human brain, for example, quite apart from its association
with a consciousness, has in the course of its
development and activity gone through a marvellous
chain of processes, in which electric and molecular
force, undulations, radiations, and probably other
physical factors of which we have no conception at
present, have played a part. Yet when the brain
dies and is resolved into so much ammonia, phosphorus,
carbon, gases, and what not, these elements
differ in no whit from other ammonia, phosphorus,
and carbon in the world. For any ulterior purpose
they are neither better nor worse; they are wholly
unchanged, by all the extraordinary history which they
have passed through under the spell of life. This is
equally true of the elements, nervous and other,
of any living being. But the physical system of
every living being below man is organized for two
ends only: (1) the upkeep, during its lifetime, of its
own physical powers; (2) the reproduction and
multiplication of its kind.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> When an organism has
fulfilled these functions, it is justified; the object
of life has been attained. These functions, of course,
persist in man, but he has added to them many
others; his brain has to serve him for ethics, art,
philosophy, religion, and is therefore organized with a
subtlety quite unknown in the animal world. Here,
then, is a kind of organic action which has no sig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>nificance
whatever <i>except in relation to consciousness</i>.
If it have none there it has none at all, it is absolutely
irrational and futile. Now the molecular and
other action of a beast’s brain has reference to its
physical life, and it passes on this physical life to
its descendants. But the action, or a great part of the
action, of a man’s brain has reference to his consciousness,
and of this he passes on at most the
potentiality. A lion’s cub is a lion; a philosopher’s
child is not necessarily or even probably a philosopher.
That path of development, whatever we may say
about the lion, must have its goal elsewhere. We
must, if the universe is not irrational, believe that in
some way consciousness, whether after the death of
the body it persists in individual form or not, <i>carries
forward into the new state the results of its experiences,
its acquisitions, its losses, in the bodily relation</i>. These
are not transitory, not indifferent; “great or small
they furnish their parts toward the soul.”</p>

<p class="tb">The reader will have probably noticed that one
consideration of the greatest moment has been left
untouched. I have spoken of matter and consciousness
as of two separate things, and of the former as
prior to the latter. This is a form of thought imposed
upon us by the space and time relations by
which our being is conditioned. But it is evident
that the interaction of the two cannot be fortuitous.
We cannot suppose that matter pursued its long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
course of evolution, refining and subtilizing at every
stage to admit more and more of the activity of
consciousness, in total disconnexion with that consciousness.
The two must be co-ordinated in some
higher synthesis. Could we escape from the limitations
of our thought we should see them, therefore,
not as two, but one, and we should see that the
meanest form of being has an aspect in which it
belongs to eternity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="center">THE ETHICAL CRITERION</p>

<p class="quot">“Things have life—God is life.”—<span class="smcap">Spinoza.</span><br />
“I am come that they may have life, and that they may have
it more abundantly.”—<span class="smcap">Rabbi Bar-elahin.</span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE view of the meaning and purpose of cosmic
development set forth in the preceding chapters
must clearly have a bearing on the principles of
human conduct. Men above a certain stage of
culture do not live by blind instinct. They endeavour
to harmonize their lives with some conception of the
<i>ratio essendi</i> of the world in which they find themselves,
and in so doing they are most truly men.
The Stoic expressed this attempt in the simple
formula, ‘Live according to Nature.’ But nature is
not simple, and the endeavour to interpret nature has
led to some very divergent ideals of human conduct.</p>

<p>Every one who has meditated on the subject at all
has become aware that the world which we see and
hear and feel, the world of sense-perception, is not all
that we have to do with. Behind the visible and
material world there lies the invisible, the <i>X</i> world,
which we cannot weigh and analyze, but the existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and potency of which we are compelled to assume.
It is the literal truth to say that no man can take
a single step even in the most mundane and practical
affairs of life without a belief, implicit or explicit,
in the spiritual unity and reality underlying the
fleeting panorama of sense-impressions. Nothing else
can give him any assurance of the constancy, the
orderly inter-relation, of the phenomena with which he
has to deal, and with which he could not deal intelligently
did not this constancy exist. Now when
man begins to be aware that there is something more
in the world than is immediately apparent to sense,
his thinking on the subject may take several different
lines, but it is probable that all of them may be
referred to one or other of two main divisions, the
Dualistic and the Monistic.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The Dualist will regard
the world of sense-perception, whether originally produced
and organized by the invisible or not, as now
more or less independent of the latter, or even hostile
to it, and he will generally interpret his own being as
something properly belonging to the invisible world
but for a time mysteriously and unhappily entangled,
through the flesh, with the other. This is Platonic
theology, carried by Paul into Christianity, and it
eventuates, when driven to its conclusion by a
rigorous and inhuman logic, in Asceticism. Instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>of the Stoic, ‘Live according to Nature’ (a formula in
complete harmony, it may be noted, with the Stoic
Pantheism), we get, as the formula for ideal conduct,
‘Deny Nature, think the flesh a burden and a shame,
fit yourself for the time when your real self will cast
it off as a filthy garment.’</p>

<p>On the other hand the Monistic view represented
in ancient Europe by the great Stoic school, and in
modern times by names such as those of Spinoza,
Hegel, Schopenhauer, Lotze, Walt Whitman, refuses
to separate the visible and the invisible worlds.
The former <i>is</i> the latter, made partially accessible to
our minds. Man is a part of nature, bound up in
all his being with the framework of the Universe.
The flesh is not a bond on the spirit but an instrument
of life, and what we acquire through it is just
as valuable and as eternal as anything else. “Objects
gross and the unseen soul are one,” says Whitman—the
distinction between subject and object, the perceiver
and the perceived, as Schopenhauer argues, is
but a mode of cognition.</p>

<p>That the human mind can rest only in some kind
of Monism, that Dualism must be regarded as a
natural but a passing phase of thought, based on a
hasty interpretation of certain aspects of man’s
moral experience, would seem to follow from what
has been urged previously from the <i>a priori</i> side of
the question.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Indeed, it may be doubted whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>there are any thinkers who seriously maintain the
Dualistic view as a philosophic doctrine. Many,
however, including the whole school of Catholic
theology, with its ascetic ideal and its doctrine of
eternal hell, turn practically Dualist in the sphere of
ethics, while they would be horrified at a suspicion
of anything but the purest Monism in their conception
of the ultimate reality of being. The cause of
this inconsistency is evident. We feel instinctively
that no distinction in the world of our present
experience goes deeper than the distinction between
moral good and moral evil. We feel the danger of
obliterating this distinction, and setting loose the
greedy and violent passions of man to work their
will unchecked by any sense of right and wrong.
And undoubtedly the Monistic principle might, by a
shallow interpretation of it, be held to obliterate the
distinction. If God is One, it might be argued, and
God is All, then evil is justified in the world equally
with goodness, and the sense of duty is, what shall
we say? an illusion, a superstition, a relic of fetishism.
Hence the practical Dualism on the ethical
and eschatological side which has found its way into
Monistic thought. It is brought in to save morality.
But inconsistencies like this do not last for ever;
they can only persist where thought has become
atrophied, and Dualism is now rapidly disappearing
from the religious thought of Europe. What is to
take its place? The problem before us is to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a basis for ethics on the Monistic hypothesis without
the slightest acceptance of the facile solutions
offered by Dualism. If we succeed in that, and
establish a real Monistic meaning for the terms <i>right</i>
and <i>wrong</i>, we shall next have to deal with the sanction
of the law of righteousness, and to show <i>why</i>
it should be obeyed even, if necessary, at the cost of
pain and death.</p>

<p class="tb">And first, let us unreservedly admit that on the
Monistic view the distinction between right and
wrong, moral good and moral evil, is not fundamental.
Both must be regarded as moving towards comprehension
in some unity as yet unimaginable by man.
Without renouncing his faith, the Monist can never
escape from that position, and he must be true to
the light whatever the apparent consequences may
be. A greater Power than he will look after the
consequences: ταῦτα τῷ θεῷ μελήσει.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, this distinction may be just
as real and vital as any other in the world of experience.
Nobody thinks that pleasure and pain are
indifferent because they are both necessary forms of
active life, or that beauty and ugliness are indifferent,
or that success and failure are indifferent. How we
strain for success in a game, for instance, although we
are perfectly well aware that the game is the real
object, not the triumph! Yet without the possibilities
of triumph or defeat, there would be no game. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
problem is really part of the primal mystery of the
origin of cosmic life. If we assume at the beginning
of things (so far as we can conceive a beginning)
one infinite, homogeneous, absolutely undifferentiated
Existence, and then conceive this Existence as impelled
to act, and to become conscious of itself, it is
plain that to do so it must differentiate itself. There
must arise within it the relations of subject and object,
simple and complex, better and worse, and all that is
involved in change, variety, progression. And this
applies as much to the moral life as to the life of the
senses. It has often been pointed out that if there
were no Wrong to strive with there would be no visible
and active Right. Were there no hate, love would be
incapable of the noblest part of its ministry. Were
there no weakness, strength could never have been
called on for the strain by which it is developed. And
if good should ever overcome and absorb evil the
stage thus attained will assuredly reveal some new
contrast of pursuit and avoidance perhaps as strange
to us now as moral distinctions would be to the lower
animals.</p>

<p>The Monist will also urge that nature, as we behold
it, is not a fixed and rounded entity, but is
something in process of completion. We must
therefore interpret nature not alone by its contents at
any given moment, but by its drift and tendency.
This is precisely the consideration which separates
Pantheism as enlightened by science from the Pan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>theism
of a primitive nature-worship. In it, the
Greek and the Hebrew ideals are blended and reconciled.</p>

<p>But what, for ethical purposes, <i>is</i> this drift and
tendency? What significance do I mean to attach to
the terms moral good and moral evil? It is hardly
necessary to say that I do not propose in a couple
of chapters of one short book to elaborate an ethical
system with all its groundwork, and with details ramifying
into every branch of ethical action, as Mr. Herbert
Spencer has essayed to do in his <span class="smcap">Data of Ethics</span>. All
I can do here, or in any section of this book, is to
indicate a <i>way</i> of looking at things—at nature, at
human life, at art—in which the meaning of the
universe has seemed to become intelligible and satisfying
to my own thought. Having found the way,
every one must use it for himself or herself. I can, in
the present work, go no further into detail than is
necessary to make my meaning clear; to set whatever
readers I may find at my point of view. If I can at
all succeed in doing this, let them use their own eyes:
they will find a wonderful landscape, vital, fresh and
boundless, opening before them.</p>

<p>The conception of ethical law which I wish to put
forward differs from what is commonly understood as
evolutionary or scientific ethics at the present day.
This system appears ultimately to rest on Jeremy
Bentham as its founder, but Bentham’s later disciples
have modified his doctrine at various points by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
deeper appreciation of the difficulties of the position.
They have approximated more closely to what I
consider to be the truth, but they have never shaken
off the entanglement of the original false position of
the modern founder of the school. Bentham, who
pursued “the greatest happiness of the greatest
number” through the medium of the most depressing
system of philosophy which the world has ever known,
made Pleasure the ultimate criterion of moral action
and declared for the summary striking out of the word
‘ought’ from the language of morals, as corresponding
to an idea which, so far as it rested on any reality,
was merely a relic of primitive superstition.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> But
J. S. Mill saw that the sentiment of duty and moral
obligation was based on something deeper and more instinctive
than a word misunderstood, and that it often
survived in persons singularly free from superstition.
He sought its origin in the psychology and physiology
of man, and interpreted it, on the principle of
association of ideas, as a survival of the deep impression
made by punishments and rewards attached
respectively to different classes of actions in each
man’s early life.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> The position was a more rational
and scientific one than that of Bentham, but it still
failed to account for the <i>a priori</i> character of the
moral sense, the ready responsiveness with which
early training evokes in man the sentiment of duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed, as it were, to have been somehow <i>prepared
beforehand</i> and to lie latent awaiting only the right
touch to spring into action. Finally, Herbert Spencer,
who may be said to have brought all this line of
thinking to its climax, seized on the evolution doctrine
as explaining this intuitive and innate quality of
ethical feeling. It <i>was</i> prepared beforehand, far back
in the ancestry of the race. Not the punishments
and rewards applied to the modern individual in his
own person, but those which affected his near and
remote progenitors, had, in the course of countless
generations, built up “moral perceptions” resulting
from “inherited modifications caused by accumulated
experiences.”<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The moral sense, therefore, is <i>now</i>
really innate because inherited, but was once acquired
by the operation of pleasures and pains arising from
man’s intercourse with nature and with his fellows.
And the ultimate moral criterion in the present day
remains simply the striking of a balance between
pleasure and pain.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>It is clear that if the Lamarckian doctrine of the
inheritance of acquired characteristics is a delusion,
the bottom is at once knocked out of the Spencerian
system of ethics. But apart from this, that system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>on the historical side at least, is vitiated by the
cardinal defect in Mr. Spencer’s mind—his failure to
appreciate the true nature of the data with which he
had to deal. The philosophic mind is not a mere
logic-machine. It must include the faculty of
vision, the vital perception of the objects of thought,
as well as the faculty of observing and of generalizing
about their action and reaction on each other,
and from this point of view Mr. Spencer’s deficiency
as a philosopher is enormous. A vital perception of
the object in this case makes us at once aware that
you cannot evolve a sense of Duty, “stern daughter
of the voice of God,” out of pleasures and pains.
Pleasures and pains <i>per se</i> will yield nothing to the
end of the chapter but the sense or the recollection of
pleasure and of pain. It is as impossible in psychology
as it is in mechanics to juggle more power out
of the end of a sequence of causes and effects than
you put in at the beginning.</p>

<p>But what has a natural ethics to put in the place
of pleasure as the goal of right action? The
question is answered when we ask, What does
Nature herself put? Nature is said to have no
morals, yet a mother bird will imperil and often lose
its life for the sake of its young. Is it seeking
pleasure then? Certainly not—it is protecting and
fostering life, the life of the race. And here, as we
have insisted so often, is the master-impulse of
nature. We are taking a false and contracted view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
when we assume that a living thing can have no
other goal of action except pleasure. Far earlier
than the appearance of man in the world is the
appearance of the social instinct which prompts
the individual to live, and if necessary to die, for the
larger life of the race. What really begins in man is
the power to think of himself, to choose, to analyze,
the power to say, Why? To this question the science
of ethics must provide an answer if it can—that, in
fact, is its origin and function. But if it binds
itself to provide an answer in terms of pleasure, it
is entering the lists with naked Egotism at a fatal
disadvantage. On that ground, it seems to me,
Egotism must always win. But it is not the only
ground. Nature knows a whole world of impulse
and effort which has nothing to do with pleasure.
<i>Nature does not directly want pleasure at all, but is
resolved, at the cost of pleasure and everything else, to
have life.</i> Now life is maintained at its highest
point by <i>harmony</i>—a harmony of the faculties with
each other and, as a whole, with the mighty life
outside them. And, as Santayana admirably says,
“harmony when made to rule in life gives reason a
noble satisfaction which we call happiness. Happiness
is impossible and even inconceivable to a mind
without scope and without pause, a mind driven by
craving, pleasure, and fear.”<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> In this sense we may
say that happiness is organically connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>right action.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> But right action in itself is simply
the action which best subserves the central purpose
of nature. If that purpose is summed up in the one
word Life, we must think of the moral sense, if we
would not go astray and be bewildered, in terms of
living and not in terms of enjoying. To take the
greatest of exemplars, who can venture to affirm that
Christ had more pleasure living as he did and uttering
to the last syllable the message that was given him to
deliver, than if he had prudently restrained himself
and led the life of a decent and respectable artisan
in his Syrian village? Indeed, even if we take very
long views, who can affirm that, on the whole, he
has by his life and death increased the sum of
pleasure in the world? I doubt it very much. No
one can deny that it is most questionable. To think
of the matter in terms of pleasure seems to lead to
nothing but perplexity and doubt. But there can
be no doubt whatever that he lived to the full the
life that it was in him to live, and that he immensely
deepened and enriched the spiritual life of man.
When we fix our minds on life as the goal and
depth and fulness of life as the criterion, we come
out at once into the clear light where high inspirations
are born and justified. But it is not only the
conception of life as existing for pleasure that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>think a true ethics will repudiate. We must clear
our minds of the idea that life has any goal outside
itself—pleasure, moral discipline, or what not. We
must fully realize the conception of life as its own
goal, its own complete satisfaction and justification.
Whoever has done this will feel as if he had escaped
from a jungle of contradiction and gloom, where
man can only live at all by clearing some little space
for his church and his homestead, and giving up the
rest to the powers of darkness. Yet a step brings
him to a point of view from which the physical,
the animal and the human features of the world’s
vast landscape seem to flow into a happy and organic
union, where every part becomes luminous
with meaning and charged with divine purpose.</p>

<p>Moral action then, I conceive, as a <i>certain kind</i> of
life-promoting action. It is action which promotes
life in the whole as opposed to the part, which sacrifices
the lower, narrower, more immediate life for the
fuller, nobler, more permanent life, whenever they
are found to clash. It does not differ in kind from
other wholesome vital action, but it differs in the
heightening, the saliency, the intention conferred
upon it by the circumstances under which it is taken.
And if we ask how it was evolved in man, the
answer is that it was there already in the instincts
of the lower animals, which are never, as man
often so sadly is, at odds with their true functions
and duties. It is not morality which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
evolved in man, but the capacity for immorality, due
to his personal self-consciousness.</p>

<p>The ultimate question, then, as regards the
abstract morality of any act or class of acts must
be, Does it make for life? Does it tend to help
man towards the maximum development <i>of all his
faculties and capacities</i>? These faculties and capacities
are what the universe has now evolved at the
highest level of which we have any knowledge.
None of them is evil, except in so far as it may
thwart and stunt the development of others. In
the harmony of the whole range of man’s powers
of sense and spirit lies the golden ideal which none
of us may realize, but for which each of us may
strive; or—for such is the supreme and fatal prerogative
of man—which he may set himself to
dishonour and deny.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="center">THE ETHICAL SANCTION</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Far, far, how far? from o’er the gates of Birth,</div>
<div class="line">The faint horizons, all the bounds of earth.”</div>
<div class="line i15"><span class="smcap">Tennyson.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ethical philosophy centres on two main
points—the ethical criterion and the ethical
sanction. We have to ask ourselves, What kind of
life ought I to live, and secondly, Why ought I to
live it? The first of these questions we have
answered simply thus: Life is self-justified; in
merely living we fulfil the whole purpose of nature;
and as life is a thing admitting of degrees it follows
that that life is best in which there is most of life.
But this does not mean apparent life for the individual
at the present moment. It means most life for
the Whole, so far as the individual acts upon the
Whole. And he acts on it in two ways—first (one
which is often overlooked) by <i>living his own life</i>
which is equally a part of that Whole whether he
lives on a desert island or in the heart of a city; and
secondly by the influence he radiates on other lives
with which his own is socially related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>This, it is clear, is quite the same thing as to say
that the right life for any man is that in which <i>for
him</i> there is most of life—the richest and the fullest
life—<i>if he were to go on living indefinitely</i>. For
whatever depresses or exalts life in the Whole must
ultimately depress or exalt it in the individual also;
the two interests are clearly identical <i>in the long run</i>.
This ‘long run’ or universal point of view, which
makes identical the interests of the Whole and the
interests of the individual, gives to a natural ethics
the criterion for all human action. It gives the contents,
though not the cogency—with this we have to
deal in the present chapter—of the word ‘ought.’</p>

<p>By the mere fact of his social relations with other
men each individual is continually being trained to
take this view, to harmonize together his egoistic and
his altruistic instincts; and is continually amassing
a store of social experiences out of which a universal
moral code is gradually shaping itself. “Life,” it has
been well said, “has saved up much wisdom.”
Ethical wisdom, in this regard, will clearly involve
such kind of action, of organization, as will afford
to each individual the fullest opportunities for vital
development in mind and body.</p>

<p>The life in which there is most of life! By holding
fast to this clue we shall, I think, see our way
through many of the obscurities in which, partly by
the search for an extra-natural basis of morality,
partly by the reactionary attempt to base morality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
simply on the striking of a balance between pleasures
and pains, the philosophy of right and wrong
has been involved. We get a natural basis for
establishing a scale in human action, a distinction
between ‘higher’ and ‘lower,’ without which a philosophic
ethics is clearly impossible. I do not, of
course, mean to say that it is possible to apply a
mechanical rule and measure to moral action in the
manner of Catholic casuistry, according to which it
is a venial sin to steal 19s. 6d. but a mortal sin to
steal £1.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Still, the existence of a natural scale
is evident at once when we consider the fact that
man is constantly being placed in positions in which
his action may either thwart and depress life, or
simply maintain it, or markedly enrich and extend it.
The ethical quality of his action appears to arise
from the fact that it is possible for him, under the
impulse of immediate personal gratification, to do
things which if commonly done by men would
destroy the beauty and order of human life. The
interests of the whole and of the individual may be
identical, as we have said, in the long run, but at the
moment they are often in violent conflict. Allowing
for the fact that it is never possible in nature to draw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>a sharp dividing line between different classes of
being, and to say absolutely that things are <i>thus</i> on
one side of it and <i>thus</i> on the other, we may repeat
that this opposition between the long-run or
universal and the momentary or personal interest is
a characteristic of human life as opposed to that of
the lower animals. It arises from the strong sense
of individuality, of selfhood, which emerges in man
and of which the animals know little or nothing. In
itself it is a new and noble power of life, but it has
its fatal and mischievous aspect. Without it we
should know neither good nor evil. Personality is
at once man’s pride and his fall.</p>

<p>With this sense of selfhood there have grown up
in humanity the faculties of Conscience and of Will.
Conscience I interpret as the sense of what is due to
the Whole, to the nobler and more permanent self.
Inasmuch as man is only gradually discovering what
it really is that the Whole demands of us, it follows
that the utterances of conscience may be misdirected,
and that they need to be corrected and purified by intelligence
and experience. We see here an example
of that principle of the combination of evolution and
involution which alone seems to make intelligible
the development of life. Never, by organizing into
a social system a multitude of individual appetencies,
can one produce a moral sense, a conscience. But
neither is conscience concerned to give the true laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
of that organization. It adds its peculiar <i>numen</i>, its
sanctity, to every effort to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Set up a mark of everlasting light</div>
<div class="line">Above the howling senses’ ebb and flow,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and though the mark itself may, indeed must, shift
and be transformed with the ripening insight of man,
yet, as between it and the temptations of sense, conscience
must always be obeyed. Now as nature is
organically one, we should expect to find this truth
not dependent merely on an intuitive perception but
written in the experiences of life. And is not this
exactly what we do find? The ethical ideals of
Judaism, of Hinduism, and of Roman Catholicism,
with their extreme reliance on external observance
and ritual, are lower, no doubt, than those of Christianity
as conceived, say, by St. Paul. Yet let a Jew
or a Hindu turn Christian, or a Catholic turn Protestant
or Freethinker, for the mere sake of material
advantages or an easier way of living, and a general
moral deterioration seems at once to set in.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Whenever
a man allows his sense of personal ease and
gratification to overpower his sense of what is due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>his fellow man, to his own higher self, to his God, he
weakens his will and his capacity for living the nobler
life. Ultimately he destroys the capacity altogether,
and with it vanishes even that for which he sinned,
the capacity for pleasure itself. The poison of self-indulgence
will slacken and corrupt every fibre of
his moral and physical being. To grasp at pleasure
indiscriminately, recklessly, greedily is a way that
makes not for life but death. On the other hand,
the capacity for renunciation and self-control, the
following of the law of love, the passion for justice
and equality, not only grow strong by exercise but,
far from injuring the other capacities which it may,
on occasion, be right to suppress for their sake, they
rather intensify these. As self-indulgence corrupts
and fatigues the whole man, even on the self-indulgent
side, so duty and righteousness vitalize and brace
the whole man, both on their own side and the other.
For Nature is one—sweet and mighty are the powers
which conspire to create the harmony she loves in the
spirits faithful to her world-wide revelation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>Now since the moral faculties bear this common
stamp upon them, that they are those which oppose
to the temptations of personal gratification the sense
of duty to something outside ourselves, and since,
when these two clash, the claim of the moral law is
always to be obeyed, it is inevitable that men will
sometimes take the denial of personal gratification for
an end <i>per se</i> and attach to it a notion of peculiar holiness
and purity. And this error will be intensified
by the ancient and inveterate habit of regarding the
Supreme Being as a malignant Power, to be propitiated
by suffering. Thus we get the false sanction
with its Ascetic ideal which has appeared so often
in history. It is the other extreme to licence, and
rests equally on disregard for the rational ideal of
Sophrosyne or Temperance which lies between them.
Yet it may truly be said that asceticism has its due
place in the world. The ascetic life cannot indeed be
the ideal life for any one who holds that plenitude of
life is the true ideal. But it may be the best life for
this or that individual. A nature maimed or scathed
from birth, or by unhappy fortune, may best be able
to realize itself in complete withdrawal from the
interests of ordinary social life. Such withdrawal
may also be necessary for the pioneer or leader of a
cause, for a great reformer, for a teacher absorbed in
his mission.</p>

<p>Philosophy, in fact, has its saints and ascetics as
well as any religion that rests on extra-natural sanc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>tions.
But in each case the ascetic ideal rests on
quite a different basis.</p>

<p>Looking broadly at the part which religious Orders
have played in the religious and intellectual history
of Europe, it may well be doubted whether even the
most gracious and human figure in the history of
asceticism, Francis of Assisi, would not have better
served his time and land by the natural development,
in secular life and activity, of the beautiful if sometimes
wildly ebullient character portrayed in the
records of his youth, than by cutting away half his
life in order to force the other half into a distorted
rarity. In recognizing the beauty and sweetness of
his nature let us not be misled into attributing it in any
degree to the influence of that fatal miasma from a
faith more ancient than any religion which has a
name and place on earth to-day, the dim terror of
the unseen which has embodied itself for ages in
expiatory sacrifices and rites of blood and pain.</p>

<p>Had Francis not been a saint he would certainly
have been one of his country’s greatest poets.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
Different minds will probably estimate differently the
loss and gain. As a poet he produced the ‘Canticle
of the Sun’; as an ascetic, the Franciscan Order.
Now it is fair to point out that this, like other Orders
of his church, must not be judged by what it is like
in times when it is surrounded by watchful and by no
means adorant eyes. A Catholic religious Order in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>Catholic country naturally lives and moves in an atmosphere
of veneration. To preserve this atmosphere
pure from the sceptical thought which, from the
monastic point of view, would vitiate it so dangerously,
is naturally a prime object of every religious
community; hence the bigotries, superstitions, and
tyrannies of which these communities have so often
been the sources or agents, from the days of Hypatia
to the days of Dreyfus. Such communities, developing
themselves under such circumstances, cannot
attract many men of intellect and character to join
them. They rapidly deteriorate, and European
literature from Boccaccio and Chaucer to Erasmus
shows us the repute in which they come to be held
by the uncloistered intellect. A false ideal may
stimulate, but it poisons. St. Francis, dreaming that
he serves God by making himself blind to God’s
world through a course of pitiless austerities,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> produces
an Order whose licence in one generation after
his death has become a scandal to Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Let us turn now to the theory of asceticism as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>conceived by the humane and rational spirit of Stoic
philosophy. Epictetus—to my mind the greatest
ethical thinker of antiquity—has a valuable and
carefully reasoned chapter on the subject in his
<span class="smcap">Dissertations</span>. In reading this after, let us say, <span class="smcap">The
Little Flowers of St. Francis</span>, one seems to pass from
the drugged atmosphere of a mediæval church to
the free air and sunlight of the world. The ascetic,
or Cynic as he was called in Stoic phraseology, is
painted for us as a man who adventures himself to
the extreme limit of abnegation, not from any mystic
sentiment of the holiness of pain and poverty, but
simply to help himself and others to realize the
soul’s independence of external things. It was a
cardinal doctrine of Stoicism (as it was of the
Christianity of Christ) that the things which a man
wrought and thought, the things under the control
of his will, were the only things that really mattered.
What happened to a man from outside was, indeed,
of great importance in regard to how he dealt with
it; in itself it was of none; it was like a ball in a
game which you have to do your best to catch, knowing
well that you do so not for the sake of the ball
but of the game. Such was the Stoic view of life,
and the Cynic represented not the perfected Stoic,
not an ideal towards which all should tend—for the
ideal was that of citizenship and well-ordered social
life—but simply the method of verification which
consists in taking an extreme case and showing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
one’s theory will fit in with it. And so Diogenes
lived in a barrel instead of a house, and asked nothing
of Alexander except to stand out of his light. It is
not more pleasing to God, not better in any way, that
a man should live in a barrel rather than in a house,
that he should be single rather than married, poor
rather than rich; yet in the chances and changes of
this mortal life all these things may happen to a man,
will he, nill he, and the point is to show that he may
still be confident and cheerful, knowing that his true
self is untouched by these calamities. And while
St. Francis and the more devoted of his followers so
tortured and wrecked the body which St. Paul had
called the temple of the Holy Spirit that many of
them perished or had to linger out their lives in the
infirmary,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> with the Cynic the cultivation of the body
and its faculties was a part of his discipline.</p>

<p class="quot">“For,” says Epictetus,<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> “if he shall appear consumptive,
meagre and pale, his witness hath not the same emphasis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Not only by showing forth the things of the spirit must he
convince foolish men that it is possible, without the things
that are admired of them, to be good and wise, but also in
his body must he show that plain and simple and open-air
living are not mischievous even to the body: ‘Behold,
even of this I am a witness, I and my body.’ So Diogenes
was wont to do, for he went about radiant with health, and
with his very body he turned many to good. But a Cynic
that men pity seems to be a beggar—all men turn away
from him, all stumble at him. For he must not appear
squalid; so that neither in this respect shall he scare men
away; but his very austerity should be cleanly and pleasing.”</p>

<p>How sane and wholesome, how wisely adapted to
the fundamental facts of life, is the Stoic ideal as
compared with the monastic! In it we see that there
is a place in a natural ethics for a rational asceticism.
Of such there will always be need—we must admit,
whatever we may think of the ‘spirituality’ of self-destruction,
that there are, and are always likely to be,
many more men and women who deteriorate in soul
and body through petty acts of self-indulgence than
who do so by an excess of austerity. And this makes
it all the more necessary that the matter should be
conceived rightly, reasonably, from the side of a reverence
for life and its manifestations, not from that of
disdain and repulsion; that we should take hold of it
(to quote Epictetus again) by the handle by which it
can be carried, not that by which theory and experience
alike have shown that it never can. When Tennyson
wrote “Move upward, working out the beast,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
was not so well inspired as in some of his other appreciations
of modern science. The religious ascetic
aims at working out the beast—not so Nature, who
does not progress by substituting one form of living
for another, but by growing from a central core
and continually harmonizing the old radical elements
of being with the new assimilations. One <i>can</i>, perhaps,
work out the beast—what cannot the will
achieve? But the beast surely avenges himself, and
often in terrible fashion.</p>

<p class="tb">When, however, we have recognized the false
sanction and the false ideal associated with it, we
have still the more difficult problem of establishing
the true. If Righteousness—to use that term
for all kinds of action ethically right—is to be
followed in the interests of life, how can it ever be
required that much suffering, and even death itself
may have to be faced for its sake? Man is a part
of a Whole—in the effective realization of that conception
all ethics is summed up—but he is also an
individual. Why should the individual give way to
the Whole if their interests seem to clash? In other
words, though we have the contents, the static significance
of the word ‘ought,’ we have still to find its
dynamic significance, its cogency.</p>

<p>Every beast does what it ‘ought’ without any
question, and this constantly involves acts of co-operation
or self-sacrifice for the interests of the race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
In man, ethical action has a greater value for life,
simply because, unlike the beast, he is able to question
its grounds and to forgo it if he chooses. He
observes, as we have said, that the ‘long run’ or
universal point of view is often in conflict with the
individual point of view. “Let us eat and drink,
for to-morrow we die” is the extreme expression
of the individual point of view. It has been called
a ‘pig-philosophy,’ and if the expression is just, it
is not because the pig will die to-morrow, for it will
probably live as long as anything else, but because
no matter how long it lives it is, <i>qua</i> pig, incapable
of any other form of life.</p>

<p>But a man is capable of other forms of life, and
to realize these he must keep the pig-life in check,
not despising or disowning it, but restraining it, lest
it should throw him out of harmony. Unchecked,
it will do that in the long run; but what if he is
to have no long run? Where the lower life can
yield an hour of delight, why deny it for the sake
of a higher life, if in the next hour both must end
together?</p>

<p>I confess that I see no escape from the implied
conclusion if the premiss is true. But if the view of
life outlined in these pages be true, then this premiss
is palpably false. Neither the higher nor the
lower life can ever have any end, though no doubt
they may pass into forms outside the category of
Time, in which the terms beginning and end have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
no longer any meaning. Life is not dependent on
its visible and tangible forms. The question here
involved is one on which the drift of certain modern
speculations in physics obliges us to dwell for a
little.</p>

<p>The question of the present inhabitability of Mars
or other planets has been much debated of late, pro
and con. Opinions differ on this point; but there is
a very general agreement among physicists that the
state of the moon, cold, dead, and barren as a burnt-out
cinder, must, by the equalization of energy, be
sooner or later the necessary fate of every planet and
of every sun in the universe. Science has thus
apparently come to justify by its solemn verdict that
cry of the Latin poet, more charged with the pathos
of eternal death than perhaps any other human
utterance:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Soles occidere et redire possunt:</div>
<div class="line">Nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux,</div>
<div class="line">Nox est perpetua una dormienda.”<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The conditions under which life is possible will
then no longer exist. One nothingness awaits the
saint, the sage, the ox, the oak tree, and the fungus.
“Life,” says Le Dantec, “has not always existed on
the earth”; we are to regard it as merely “a sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>face
accident in the history of the thermic evolution
of the globe.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>This remark, which is one that a thermometer
might be expected to make if it could talk, is in
Le Dantec’s mouth probably no more than a little
rhetorical fling at orthodoxy, for it is really answered
by his whole book. His main thesis is “the absence
of all essential difference and all absolute discontinuity
between living and not-living matter.” “A
surface accident” can hardly be a reasonable description
of a development thus prepared for in the
essential nature of the substance of the world. But
other physicists have lately cut deeper, and will not
allow the suns of Catullus, even when cold, to set and
rise again for ever. According to the very interesting
and apparently well-supported speculations of Gustave
Le Bon,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> all matter is at present engaged in that process
of disintegration of which radium offers the
most conspicuous example. The energy which produces
life and response of all kinds is explained as
simply the result of this long, disintegrating process,
and may be compared to the action of a released
spring, seeking its state of quiescence and immobility.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
When the process is complete, matter will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>resolved into the primordial Something from which it
somehow originated. And where will the saint and
the sage, or anything that we can recognize as life, be
then?</p>

<p>The answer to all this rises to the mind at once
when we abandon the point of view of the thermometer
and place ourselves at that of rational Man.
This Matter, on whose states life is supposed to be
dependent, is, after all, known to us only through the
fact that we are living to observe it. If it disappeared,
no doubt we should cease to see it, and if
it were transformed we should see it otherwise, but to
make the life which sees dependent on our seeing anything
exactly as it appears now on this globe is surely
the wildest of assumptions. We observe that life
makes use of certain conditions of matter—a certain
range of temperature, the presence of certain minerals
and gases—in order to express itself. We regard
these conditions as the product of a Power which
desires life and has produced them to obtain it. But
there may be many other conditions too. All we
can tell is that beyond certain physical limits our
senses cannot perceive life or get responses from it.
M. Le Dantec would, no doubt, treat as an illusion
the belief that man can communicate with and be
responded to by a Power, a Life, transcending that of
which the senses inform us. I am, with the multitude
of men, profoundly convinced that we can. But
leaving this entirely aside, is it not evident that, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
as there are invisible rays in the spectrum which are
now and then discovered by some unexpected
chemical or electrical action, so there may be modes
of living of which none of our present senses can
give us the faintest conception? Whoever may deny
this possibility, and on whatever grounds, it certainly
cannot be denied on any grounds that physics or
biology are aware of. And to those who believe that
life is the central thing, and that matter exists only
for it, the possibility is a certainty, for life must have
been when as yet matter was not—life set it going.
To convey the idea that everything that exists, however
it may be transformed, is part of a divine Whole
which cannot die because it is essential Life, we say
that it is ‘immortal,’ and conceive ourselves as existing
after death in a spiritual form just as the body exists
after the bodily death in other bodily forms. Whether
time and space, or even personality, will exist for us
after death we dare not say; we are totally unable to
imagine the conditions of such an existence. But we
can perfectly grasp the broad fact that whatever we
do and are, whatever we think, whatever transacts
itself even in the unconscious sphere of our existence,
must have eternal endurance and significance because
it is knit with the eternal Whole.</p>

<p class="quot">“To the foot,” says Epictetus, “I shall say that it is
according to Nature that it be clean; but if you take it as
a foot, and not as a solitary thing, it shall beseem it to go
into the mud, and to tread on thorns, and perchance to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>cut off, for the sake of the whole; otherwise it is no longer
a foot.<br /><br />

“And some such thing we should suppose about ourselves
also. What art thou? A man. Look at thyself as
a solitary creature, and it is according to Nature for thee to
live to old age, to grow rich, and to keep good health. But
if thou look upon thyself as a man, and as a part of a certain
whole, for the sake of that whole it may become thee
now to have sickness, now to sail the seas, and run into
peril, now to suffer need, and perchance to die before thy
time.<br /><br />

“Why, then, dost thou bear it hard? Knowest thou not
that, as the foot, alone, is not a foot, <i>so thou, alone, art not a
man</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<p>The broad fact on which a system of natural
ethics must be based, if it is to have any ethical
quality at all, is that <i>the individual life finds its goal
in the cosmic life</i>, not in pleasure, or any other term
by which we may choose to express a sensation
of personal enjoyment. The distinction between
the <i>bonum honestum</i> and the <i>bonum delectabile</i> is
really a valid one—it is no invention of moralists
“suckled in a creed outworn,” but is revealed by
a study of life and its manifestations to have been
deeply rooted in nature from a period far anterior
to the advent of man upon the earth. In man,
the <i>bonum honestum</i> takes the form mainly of what
Epictetus calls the sense of “natural fellowship”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>among men, and what Christ expressed in the word
which gave to the ideas of Stoicism the penetrating
power they had lacked, the great and divine word,
Love. But we must never forget that even this
word will not take us to our end and sum up a
system of ethical thought unless we rightly conceive
the ultimate object to which it is directed. This is
not the visible community of men, nor even that of
all nature, now existing or to exist in the future. It
is the ideal, eternal community, of which every man
remains equally an organic part, whether he has any
means of physical communication with his fellows or
not. It is that without which the visible community,
with all its laws and inter-relations, would never have
come into being. It is the “city of God,” builded
without hands, the Universal Polity whose “troubled
image,” as Plato says, we discern in the polity we
know.</p>

<p>When Socrates, after his sentence, lay in prison
awaiting the summons to die, his friends gathered
round him entreating him to make his escape, and
explaining to him the safe and easy means they had
provided for that end. Freely and cheerfully as was
his wont, delighting in the play of dialectical fence,
he debated the matter with them. Then he laid
dialectics aside, and spoke to them from the heights
of vision. Rightly or wrongly, he declared, the laws
of his mother-city, to which he owed all he had and
all he was, had bidden him die. Whatever happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
now, there could be no escape in the end. Some day
he must face death, and stand before the Laws of the
Underworld. What answer should he make to Them
when they demanded how he had dealt in life by
their brethren in the world above?</p>

<p>This grand impersonation of the eternal Laws in
their kinship with the laws of the visible world
illumines a whole region of thought, extending far
beyond the limits of the particular moral question
which evoked it. It strikes the note of all high
thinking on man’s duty to man. The laws, written
or unwritten, that govern societies of men can claim
no reverence from the individual who does not feel
that they are the shadows or copies of laws belonging
to the sphere of the eternal.</p>

<p>It is one thing to admit that the social relations of
mankind give the start to ethical feeling, provide it
with a wide and varied field of action, and with a
criterion as to what is right and what is not. It is quite
another to argue that this ethical feeling is merely a
product of these relations, and has, apart from them,
no meaning or purpose. This is another case of the
principle which I have described before<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> in speaking
of Evolution and Involution. Without both of these
I cannot see how any movement from one state of
being to another is to be accounted for. People, or
even animals, living in communities find that mutual
aid is useful to them, and they practise it. The utili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>tarian
school think, when they have demonstrated
this, that the whole ethical question is solved. But
in reality they have not even approached it. Mutual
aid is useful? Well, then, it is useful. How are we
going to get any further? How are we going to
account for love, duty, fidelity, self-sacrifice? Because
certain things appear in the world under certain
conditions we have, many of us, got into a slipshod
way of saying that they are the product of these
conditions, but a strict examination of the terms will
frequently show that they are nothing of the kind.
There is no valid reason why social life and mutual
aid should not go on for ever without producing anything
higher than the sense of mutual advantage.
The nobler passions do indeed come into life when
the proper stage of social evolution has been reached,
but their source is not within the bounds of the
visible order, nor do I see how they can ever justify
themselves with reference to it alone. Neither, on the
other hand, can they be realized without it. The
divine air which we breathe on the mountain height
is not made by the mountain, but we must climb the
mountain to breathe it. Every step we take upwards
in the visible order is, as it were, the discovery of
something in that invisible order which is its spiritual
counterpart and gives it its spiritual significance.</p>

<p class="tb">I have said that ethics is for life; but to the
individual it must sometimes appear to be rather for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
death than for life, unless he knows that there is a
life beyond the visible life. In this faith only—in
whatever varied forms the intellect of man has embodied
and expressed it—are martyrdoms possible.
And martyrdoms have been so often the great
turning-points and inspirations of human history
that an ethics which cannot justify them would seem
to be an ethics at odds with nature. Consider from
our point of view the significance of the two martyrdoms
of history which have most deeply impressed
and influenced the minds of men.</p>

<p>Socrates had no gospel, no new truth to proclaim.
He dissociated himself from the ‘rationalistic’
theories of his time, not indeed because he was particularly
attached to ancient ideas in religion, but
because theorizing on these subjects had no interest
for him.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> On his trial he expressly disclaimed
heretical views on religion. It is clear that these
were only charged against him because the real
offence was no crime in Athenian or any other law.
The real offence was that Socrates was a relentless
critic, within reach of whose tongue no patriotic
rhetorician could feel himself confident and comfortable.
It was a time of rhetorical patriotism in
Athens. From the bitter humiliation of the Peloponnesian
War had arisen an impulse towards
national regeneration, a genuine and worthy impulse
in itself, but one which unfortunately took shape not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>in a manly facing of facts, a courageous march
forward to the future, but rather in a panic-stricken
retreat to old conservative formulas and
bigotries, to the abandonment of which by cultivated
Athenians was ascribed all the evil that had fallen
on the city. Socrates, however, delighted in taking
popular convictions and reducing them by a series of
ingenious interrogations to their verifiable residuum
of truth, if there happened to be any. They commonly
emerged from the ordeal in a dilapidated condition.
At a time when the whole city was high strung
with patriotic fervour while inwardly very uncertain
about its principles of action, the presence of a thinker
like Socrates, with his pitiless arraignment of every
gaudy fallacy before the bar of Reason, was a continual
scandal and offence, and was easily interpreted
as a public danger. Had he consented to keep
silent, and affected to fall in with the general trend of
public sentiment, he would, as he well knew, have
been safe. But he refused all compliance and compromise,
and declared with absolute truth that Athens
would do better to reward him for stinging it into a
perception of realities than to punish him for the
wholesome pain of the process. So he went with
clear-sighted deliberation to his death, and that death,
so wonderfully recorded for us by the greatest prose
writer of all time, has ennobled all criticism, all sceptical
thought, thenceforward. None can think lightly
of what Socrates thought it worth his while to die for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Turn to the death of Christ, and into how different
an atmosphere we seem to pass! No philosopher
has here recorded for us the death of a philosopher.
Myth and legend have clustered round the great
event—the Jewish conception of an expiatory sacrifice—the
truer and profounder myth of a slain and
re-arisen God—and these have wrapped the Crucifixion
in such a cloud of mystical light and colour that the
outlines of the historical fact are lost to view. When
this cloud is pierced, however, an intelligible human
transaction remains. In Christ the luminous purity
of Greek reason was so blended with the religious
fervour of the Eastern mind that he may justly be
called the ideal man, the Son of Man and of God,
the incarnation of the divine thought. Unlike Socrates,
he was distinctly a heretic in his place and time.
He appeared among a people deeply religious but
one in whom religion had taken the form of an immense
fabric of ceremonial and observance, guarded
and administered by a special caste who conceived
themselves as the appointed vehicle of the will
of God for the untaught multitude. To this multitude
Christ went direct. He led them straight to
the ancient founts of light and life, disregarding
the narrow channels hewn by Pharisaic formalism.
He bade them open their eyes and see for themselves;
he taught them that the truth was for all
men; beside the conceptions of the authorized
religion he set new conceptions which made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
old seem barren or ludicrous. The people heard
him gladly, and the great fabric of Pharisaism was
manifestly tottering. The fury of a monopolist caste
was aroused. There is no more merciless anger than
the anger of the religious monopolist who sees his
monopoly threatened, and to this anger Christ fell a
victim. As Socrates died for the right to disbelieve,
so Christ died for the right to believe, and whatever
the churches have made of him he has inspired every
revolt against priestcraft and authority ever since.
No creed is worth living for which is not worth dying
for. Christ’s death and spiritual resurrection<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> set the
seal on this truth and gave the world the most signal
instance in history of triumph arising out of defeat
and death.</p>

<p>Volumes of argument and analysis could not confute
an ethical system so effectually and so severely
as the bare fact that it looked paltry or incongruous
beside such lives and deaths as these.</p>

<p class="tb">The conclusions we have reached in this discussion
of the basis of a natural ethics may now be summed
up. We have interpreted the object of phenomenal
Being as Life.</p>

<p>The ethical quality of life lies in its conscious and
active harmony with the Whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>The motive for ethical action lies in the fact that
we are a part of that Whole. The sense of this
relation is as deep a part of man’s nature as the sense
of his selfhood, or deeper.</p>

<p>To live for Others, then, is no more the true
epitome of a natural ethics than is, to live for Self.
The true epitome is, Live for the Whole—the Whole
which includes both others and yourself, which is
greater than all humanity, yet is capable of being
faithfully served in the silence of one human breast.</p>

<p>We have now before us, therefore, a clear conception
of the criterion and the sanction of ethical
action. The criterion is applied when we ask of
anything done by man, “Does it further life in the
Whole?” The sanction is found in the fact that
each of us is an organic part of that Whole. The
richest and fullest life is evidently to be won by the
most complete development of all our faculties which
is allowed us by our opportunities. Ethics, therefore,
exists for life, not life for ethics. This simple
proposition arises inevitably from the scientific conception
of the world. The greatest of fallacies is
to conceive life as existing for any other object
whatsoever, or to define its aim as something more
or less remote from our present existence. Our
‘eternal life’ is not something to come—we are
living it here and now. This is not a pilgrimage
or a place of preparation; it leads us to no heaven,
no hell, no distant judgment seat. We are before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
that judgment seat every hour; the heaven and the
hell which it dispenses are the daily experiences
through which we move; and the saints and prophets
of this faith are those who have felt most deeply and
revealed most profoundly the great realities of existence,
hidden from us not so much by the darkness
of the grave as by the impalpable veils of use and
wont. The grave has mystery indeed but no terror
of gloom for those who realize that the universe
is but an eddy on the stream of life. By that eddy
we see the stream, we feel its power and movement;
and we know that the substance of which it is made
is the stuff of life itself.</p>

<h2>PART III: ART</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="center">ART AND LIFE</p>

<p class="center f85">“Like a living thing, one and whole.”—<span class="smcap">Aristotle.</span><a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE third chapter of Tolstoy’s book, What is
Art? contains a summary of the opinions of
some sixty modern writers (taken chiefly from
Schasler’s <span class="smcap">Kritische Geschichte der Aesthetik</span>)
on the essential meaning of the terms Art
and Beauty. All these opinions, after having been
duly paraded across the stage, are dismissed by
Tolstoy as a mass of “enchanted confusion and contradictoriness,”
and he then proceeds to build up his
own theory of art. As the latest critical treatment of
the subject on a large scale by a thinker and an
artist who has made a deep impression on the minds
of men, his conclusions deserve careful attention
on the part of any later writer who desires to deal
with the perennially attractive but very obscure
problems of æsthetics. Let me begin by quoting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>the passage with which Tolstoy closes the fourth
chapter of his work:—</p>

<p class="quot">“To the question What is this Art, to which is offered up
the labour of millions, the very lives of men, and even
morality itself? we have extracted replies from the existing
æsthetics which amount to this—that the aim of art is
beauty, that beauty is recognized by the enjoyment it gives,
and that artistic enjoyment is a good and important thing
because it <i>is</i> enjoyment. In a word, that enjoyment
is good because it is enjoyment. Thus, what is considered
the definition of art is no definition at all, but only a shuffle
to justify existing art. Therefore, however strange it may
seem to say so, in spite of the mountains of books written
about art, no exact definition of art has been constructed.
And the reason of this is that the conception of art has been
based on the conception of beauty.”<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>Now in one point at least, that which is embodied
in the last sentence, these words of Tolstoy’s appear
to me to go straight to the mark. Art can no more
be founded on beauty than morality can be founded
on pleasure. A greater than Tolstoy has spoken the
same truth in a couple of his mighty lines. The
great masters, says Whitman,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">... do not seek beauty, they are sought,</div>
<div class="line">Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But let us see what Tolstoy would set up in place of
what he throws down. Art, he tells us, is “one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>the means of intercourse between man and man.”
“By words a man transmits his thoughts to another,
by means of art he transmits his feelings.” But the
transmission must, if it is art, be intentional, premeditated.
“Art begins when one person with the
object of joining another or others to himself in one
and the same feeling expresses that feeling by certain
external indications.” The “indications” may, of
course, be a certain kind of language, or gesture, or
plastic representation, or sound. If, by such means,
a man has succeeded in making his own feeling
<i>infectious</i>, and affecting others by it, he has, to that
extent achieved art. Art is therefore “a means of
union among men, joining them together in the
same feelings, and is indispensable for the life and
progress towards well-being of individuals and of
humanity.”<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>Certainly one cannot but admire the strong clear-headedness
and common sense with which Tolstoy
blows away the mists into which he had plunged us
in his third chapter, and brings us into a region of
daylight realities, with firm earth under our feet.
Undoubtedly if man does want to get into real contact
with his fellow-men he must not merely tell them
what he feels, he must make them feel the same
thing. And art, produced with “individuality, clearness
and sincerity” has this property, to use Tolstoy’s
own term, of infectiousness. Moreover it is of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>enormous antiquity and has exceedingly primitive
forms. There may have been art before there was
speech—there was certainly art before there was
writing, before there was anything remotely resembling
intellectual culture or religion. The metaphysical
definitions of Hegel, “The Idea shining
through Matter,” or of Knight, “The union of object
and subject, the drawing forth from nature of that
which is cognate to man,” and of the rest of the
sixty and odd philosophers, do, I think, look a little
irrelevant when we think of the cave-man scratching
his bit of mammoth ivory. But Tolstoy’s account
of the matter glows with reality. The cave-artist was
struck with something in nature—the reindeer drinking
at a pool, the mammoth swinging through the
jungle—he longed to express it, to make others see.
It can hardly be doubted that this was the origin of
art <i>as art</i>.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> I think it is its fundamental quality
even now, though we must include among the objects
rendered things not in external nature but in the
artist’s own imagination.</p>

<p>The questions then arise, What is it that the artist
is trying to infect other people with? Is art quite
indifferent to the nature of the feeling communicated?
Is there any common feeling expressed by things apparently
so diverse as a strain of music, a piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>pottery, a cathedral, a lyric, a statue, and a landscape
painting?</p>

<p>Tolstoy does not overlook these questions; he
has, in fact, a great deal to say about them. But
here, in his analysis of the æsthetic faculty, the obsession
with the exclusively ethical view of things
which has so much impaired his own art seems to
have led him on a false track. Having decided that
infectiousness is the common quality of all art, he
is struck with the fact that this quality varies very
much in different works, and he uses it to obtain a
scale of merit:—</p>

<p class="quot">“Not only,” he writes, “is infection a sure sign of art,
but the degree of infectiousness is also the sole measure of
excellence in art. The stronger the infection the better is
the art, as art, speaking now apart from its subject matter,
<i>i.e.</i> not considering the quality of the feelings it transmits.”<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>This statement is obviously meaningless unless
you define the nature of the person who is to be
infected. Infection is as much a matter of the
mind infected as of the agent which infects. “The
stronger the infection for such and such an audience
...” is what we shall have to read. The
audience must be a constant element if the definition
is to convey any distinct meaning. Perceiving
this, as so acute a mind could not fail to do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>Tolstoy falls back on exactly the same criterion
as that of Bishop Butler when he endeavoured to
get a universal standard of right and wrong. Butler
set up as final judge in these matters the “plain
honest man.”<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> You were to appeal to the unsophisticated
conscience of this ideal being, and that ended
the matter. So, with Tolstoy, you are to get the
“unperverted” man who, like an animal, “unerringly
finds what he needs.”<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Most people in our society,
says Tolstoy, “are quite unable to distinguish a
work of art from the grossest counterfeit.” They
like, or pretend to like, Beethoven better than a
peasant folk-song! But the peasant’s, <i>i.e.</i> the untaught,
appreciation, which is merely bewildered by
Beethoven, is right.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> This, we ultimately find,
simply means that the “plain honest man,” as conceived
by Tolstoy, is one who appreciates the <i>moral</i>
contents of a work of art, provided that it has any,
and that it has infection enough to get them into his
mind. And Tolstoy (the art-critic) does not care
about anything except these moral contents.</p>

<p>This is clear when he comes to deal with the
element which he mentions above as having been
omitted from his consideration of the comparative
value of art-work, namely the quality of the feeling
transmitted by the medium of art. Here he lays it
down that the object of all art is to unite mankind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>and to make them feel at one with God and with
each other.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> This may pass very well if by uniting
is meant enabling us to enter with sympathy into
the life of man, and even of things that are not man.
Even so a drawing by Nettleship can make us feel at
one with a python or a tigress. But Tolstoy does
not mean that. His uniting is a moral and practical
idea based on the doctrine that combat, and everything
that could lead to combat, is wrong. Ancient
religious perceptions, he argues, confined the sense
of unity to the tribe or nation, and art had to glorify
solely the might or greatness of the people who produced
it. Modern religion, on the contrary, takes
account of all humanity without exception. “And
therefore the feelings transmitted by the art of our
time not only cannot coincide with the feelings
transmitted by former art, but must run counter to
them.”<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Only two kinds of art, according to Tolstoy,
“can be considered good art in our time.”
These are first, “art transmitting feelings flowing
from a religious perception of man’s position in the
world in relation to God and to his neighbours,” and
secondly, “art transmitting the simplest feelings of
common life, but such, always, as are accessible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>all men in the whole world—the art of common life—the
art of a people—universal art.”<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> As instances
of these types of good modern art, Tolstoy gives his
amazing list—Schiller’s <span class="smcap">Robbers</span>, <span class="smcap">Les Misérables</span>,
Dickens’s and Dostoievsky’s novels, <span class="smcap">Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</span>, and <span class="smcap">Adam Bede</span>. In painting we are to
take as types of excellence “the drawing by Kramskoy
(worth many of his finished pictures), showing
a drawing-room with a balcony past which troops
are marching in triumph on their return from the
war. On the balcony stands a wet-nurse holding a
baby and a boy. They are admiring the procession
of the troops, but the mother, covering her face with
a handkerchief, has fallen back on the sofa, sobbing.”
Or one may turn to “a picture by the French artist,
Morlon, depicting a lifeboat hastening in a heavy
storm to the relief of a steamer that is being
wrecked.”<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>It is easy to make fun of this headlong descent
to the level of the parish magazine, but it is not so
easy to challenge the position from which Tolstoy
deduces his criticisms of individual works, or to deny
that he has again and again struck home with incomparable
force against the factitious art so current in
the present day. His book is a piece of genuine
thinking, and in this it has few rivals among contemporary
works of æsthetic criticism, especially in
English. Most of these works are either pæans of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>praise for what the critic finds attractive and stimulating
to his own temperament, or attacks conducted
with every resource of satire and ridicule on what he
does not understand or care for. But a serious
attempt like that of Tolstoy to discover and to apply
a true principle of art criticism is very much to seek;
and I venture to think that many critics who are
horrified at the notion of putting <span class="smcap">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span>
above <span class="smcap">King Lear</span> would find it by no means so easy
as they suppose to give a rational account of the
faith that is in them. Tolstoy’s conclusions, like
those of Plato in <span class="smcap">The Republic</span> (which they very
much resemble), are wrong-headed, but his manner
of thinking is that of a massive and nobly ordered
intellect, and is well worthy of respectful imitation
at whatever distance lesser powers can contrive to
follow it.</p>

<p>I know nothing whatever (I regret to say) about
the art of Kramskoy or of Morlon, but one imagines,
from Tolstoy’s way of talking about the works
referred to, that they are attempts to capture admiration
for a work of art by the aid of something which
is not art, but sentiment. At any rate, that is just
what Tolstoy desires them to do. Is art, then, entirely
indifferent to subject, as some of the philosophers
of the Impressionist school contend? Not at all—so
long as the subject is something <i>in the picture</i>, and
capable of being expressed in the medium of that
branch of art. A crew of men pulling a boat through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
a heavy sea may be a good subject for a painting, but
to the artist it does not matter a pin’s point whether
they are going to rescue life or to board an enemy or
to catch lobsters. Under the circumstances they will
all look just the same. The wreck in the offing has
its value in the design of the picture, no more and no
less. And those who are always on the look out for
false values, sentimental values, will never learn what
art really has to teach them, what art alone can teach.
What is this?</p>

<p class="tb">The master key with which we have tried to open
certain doors in biology and in ethics will, I hope,
serve us also in discovering the principles of art. I
accept fully Tolstoy’s postulate of infectiousness as
a primary quality of art. There can be no art which
does not communicate to others the feeling of the
artist. This implies that the artist must have a
distinct and sincere feeling to communicate. But it
does not at all imply that the finest art is that which
is most widely or powerfully communicable at its
first appearance or at any given period in history.
To say that infectiousness is an essential characteristic
of art is not the same thing as to say that the
more it infects, either extensively or intensively,
the better art it is. One might as well say that if,
as has been done, you define man as ‘a political
animal,’ it would follow that the more strenuously
political he was the more he fulfilled the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of his being as a man. But politics and art are both
of them simply ways in which man endeavours to
remould his universe “nearer to the heart’s desire.”
How does he make use of political methods <i>for his
true purpose</i>? How does he make use of art and its
infectiousness <i>for his true purpose</i>? These are the
real, the decisive questions.</p>

<p>What is the essential thing communicated in art?
The question is answered at once if we reflect that as
life can have no ulterior object beyond life, and is
satisfied when the maximum of living is attained,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> so
life must be the ultimate object of art also. It is the
<i>quality</i> of art to communicate feeling; it is the <i>object</i>
of art to communicate a feeling for life. <i>Art is man’s
expression of life</i>; and he delights in art precisely
because and in so far as he delights in life. But
if this be all, it may be objected, why, with life in full
glow and activity all around him, should man turn to
this reflection or rendering of it which he calls art?
What place does the reality leave for the enjoyment
of the shadow? This was substantially Plato’s indictment
of art in the last book of <span class="smcap">The Republic</span>. All
things exist, according to his well-known doctrine
of ideas, in an ideal or archetypal form, a “pattern
laid up in heaven.” There is such a pattern, let us
say, of a Bed, and this is the real, the archetypal
Bed. Copying some reflection of this in his own
mind, the carpenter makes a material, individual bed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>Then comes in the painter, who copies the bed of the
carpenter, and who is thus at two removes from
Reality; art, in Plato’s view, being simply imitation,
and therefore somewhat despicable.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>There are some minor, yet by no means trivial,
reasons which might be given in answer to this
objection; as, for instance, that art enables one to
assemble together in small compass the expressions
of a great variety of life not to be directly enjoyed,
save at wide intervals of time and place. But the
primary and fundamental reasons are our main concern
here.</p>

<p>In the first place, the material world around us, or
such portion of it as we are able to perceive, is not, as
it stands, a pure expression of life. Holding as we
do with Cleanthes in his majestic Hymn to Zeus that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>all things redundant have their place in the Whole,
and that in it all things ugly have their beauty and
all things hateful their share of love,<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> it is still true
that the world as we see it presents us with a
pell-mell of varied forms—some mature and beautiful,
some in process of transition, some in decay, some
stationary, unchanging, dead. The inner harmony
which holds them together is rarely perceptible in
any one fragment of actual life. But the artist adds
this harmony, this completeness; his work, within its
own limits, is a whole. He gives us something which
nature cannot give. Taking some aspect of life
which he wishes to convey by means of line, colour,
or tone, he suppresses, alters, composes, emphasizes,
till he has expressed his feeling in its purity, with
everything immaterial left out and with the things
essential to his conception lifted clearly into view.
His work is therefore greater and more vital than
nature, that is to say than any fragment of nature,
for he is looking at the part he renders <i>sub specie
aeternitatis</i>, in the light of the Whole. And living in
the conception of a great work of art, we live in the
Whole; the individual has sunk from view.</p>

<p>Zola has finely said, “Art is a bit of Nature seen
through the medium of a temperament.” This
temperament means the artist’s personal way of
seeing life; it means all that makes his art different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>from a mere record. And the audience who see or
hear his work become acquainted with this temperament—there
is no other way in which the artist can
express it so well. The artist, then, is giving us
himself along with his subject, and this is the greatest
thing he can give. Whether the wars of Troy ever
happened is of very little consequence compared
with Homer’s way of imagining them. And when we
have learned Homer’s way we can and do apply it
for ourselves, for has he not ‘infected’ us with it?
The artist opens our eyes, and leaves us in a world
infinitely more significant and beautiful than without
his aid we should ever have known it to be. His
function is thus the liberation within us of faculties,
of powers of living, which otherwise might never
have risen into consciousness. We commonly call
this ‘idealizing the facts of life.’ It would be nearer
the mark to say that it makes them real. Art turns
our formal, sensible, external perceptions of things
into real and vital perceptions, and thus enormously
increases the range and volume of life of which those
who apprehend it are capable. The glory of light,
the music of winds and waters, the dignity of man’s
common occupations, the wonder and sweetness of
the love of men and women, all these have been
revealed to us by the artist, “a man speaking to men
... pleased with his own passions and volitions, who
rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life that
is within him.”<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>The essential purpose of any art-work, then, is to
be <i>expressive of life</i>—more expressive than the raw
facts of life ever can be. The practical problem for
every artist in every kind of material is how to make
his work expressive; only thus can it be what Tolstoy
calls “infectious.” To do this, besides the acquirement
of technique, he must clearly have something
to express. Let us not imagine, however, as the
“plain honest man” is apt to do, that this must
necessarily be something capable of being put into
terms of the intellect—a fact, a story, a “criticism of
life.” Art is rather an exploration than a criticism
of life.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> And life is very great and manifold. Primarily
the painter is a man who likes to apprehend
life in colour, the sculptor one who apprehends it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>the form of masses, the musician in sound, the poet
in actions, emotions, ideas. Each may, and probably
must, have some of the gifts and faculties of the
others, but as painter, musician, or whatever he may
be, he thinks and feels in the material of his own art,
and he uses that material to express its own virtues,
not to imitate those of another.</p>

<p class="tb">The question of the relation of art to beauty, and
the meaning of beauty itself, may now be considered.
What is this mysterious element about the nature of
which such a torrent of opinion has been poured out
since man first began to reflect on his own states of
mind? Between the view which holds it to be an
absolute and ultimate principle, recognized in, rather
than arising from, experience, and that which denies
it any right to be called a principle at all, referring it
simply to the effect of habit, and refusing to see any
essential difference between the Hottentot conception
of beauty and the Greek, we can find, I think, a
position in strict accordance both with the historical
facts of the evolution of the conception and with
the claims of the Idealists.</p>

<p>Let us look back a moment to the analysis of
moral action which we made in the preceding chapters.
We found then that while all healthy action tends to
maintain and promote life, there are circumstances
under which this life-promoting quality comes more
saliently into view than is usual. This happens in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
general when mere personal desires are subjected to
the larger life of the Whole, or when a lower form of
living is subjected to a higher. This heightening and
intensification of life-promoting action we called moral
action. And we drew no sharp and distinct line
between it and ordinary healthy action, for nature
knows no such distinctions, and the philosophy which
tries to establish them is stamped with unreality.</p>

<p>In regard to Beauty we have only to take up the
same point of view as we did in regard to Ethics,
and the mystery lies clear before us at once. All
nature is in some sense expressive of life, even when it
seems most desolate or most degraded; for life as we
know it means change, variety, contrast, and, under
the conditions of space and time, one can no more
have life without death and decay than one can have
height without depth. But all nature does not equally
express life, and much of it, as we have seen, does not
express it at all to our perceptions. Beauty arises,
then, when we find a certain heightening, a saliency, an
intensity in the expression or vitality, whether by
external nature or, in art, by man. Thus Life, not
Beauty, is the mark of art, but beauty is the signal
that the mark has been hit.</p>

<p>As with the moral, so with the æsthetic sense—we
find it in all stages of development. A man or a
race whose range of life is contracted to a few physical
enjoyments and pains will set the idea of beauty in
whatever expresses or is associated with these enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>ments.
A wider, loftier, subtler conception of life
will bring forth a nobler beauty. We are not, on this
theory, abandoned to a mere subjective and arbitrary
preference, according as we are trained and accustomed
to this type or to that. There is a perfectly
valid and objective criterion in the question, Which
represents the fullest and strongest life? The Greek
ideal surpasses the Hottentot—to take two extremes—because
the Greek is capable of all that the Hottentot
can do or feel—he takes it all up into his
larger life; but the Hottentot can only live in a small
sector of the sphere occupied by the Greek. Instead,
therefore, of the two opposing battlecries of ‘Art for
Morals’ and ‘Art for Art,’ let us set that of ‘Art
for Life.’ For Life is greater than either art or
morals; it includes and justifies them both.</p>

<p>The characteristics of Beauty will be further discussed
in connexion with some of the individual arts,
which we have now to range under our general
principle.</p>

<p class="tb">The more deeply life is studied and felt, the more
strongly do two great and cardinal principles of it
come into view. These are opposed to each other,
but complementary; and thus life in general appears
to exhibit that singular quality of polarity
which seems so intimately to pervade all its separate
manifestations; everything which lives and moves
appearing to do so by virtue of the action of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
opposing forces. These two poles of the axis of life
are, on the one hand, what we call Order, Continuity,
Rhythm; and on the other, Change, Variety, Contrast.
If Order were not, Change would become
chaos. If Change were not, Order would become
death. In neither case would growth and development
be possible.</p>

<p>An art, therefore, however abstract, like Music or
like the decorative pattern in a Celtic MS., which
expressed the union of these two principles might be
profoundly expressive of life. It need not set before
us any definite living thing provided it expresses the
cardinal principles of all life. It will do this the
better the more intimately these principles are
blended, as in nature, into a vital unity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, art does, of course, frequently
represent individual objects, and probably had its
first distinguishable beginnings in so doing.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> We
may, then, get a broad classification of the arts by
placing on one side those which deal with objects of
sense, and on the other those which convey life under
forms devised by the artist himself, and not found in
the external world. One is tempted to call these
respectively Imitative and Creative. But, after all,
what is essentially artistic in the first category is just
the fact that it is <i>not</i> purely imitative, for, as Mr.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>
<p>Whistler observed, to suppose that you can get art by
copying nature is equivalent to thinking that you can
get music by sitting on the piano. On the other
hand, it does not seem fitting to use so exalted a word
as creation with reference to the pattern which a Zuñi
Indian draws on a piece of pottery, while denying it
to a painting by Titian. Instead, therefore, of using
the words Creative and Imitative—now that we
know what we mean by them—we shall contrast those
arts which are directly Presentative with those which
are Representative. In the one case the artist presents
us with the whole artistic product, form and
substance, as devised by himself. In the other, he
represents to us forms already presented by nature,
but re-composed, re-presented, and harmonized by him
for an æsthetic purpose.</p>

<p class="tb">The Presentative arts fall into two classes. In one
of these Music stands alone. Here the artistic purpose
is not only dominant but (I speak, of course, of
music in its highest and most characteristic development)
there is no other purpose whatever. The
forms elaborated by combinations and sequences of
sound have no object except that of art and mean
nothing apart from that. Hence Music has been
called ‘pure style.’ We shall recur to this subject
when we have dealt with the other class, that of
the Decorative arts, the essence of which it is to add
an expression of rhythm, of world-harmony, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
objects whose primary purpose is something different—a
building, a vase, a piece of furniture, or a hanging.
This class, again, can be subdivided into arts which
attain this effect by the structure of the object, and
those which do so by the application of ornament to
its surface; both being, of course, often combined in
the same object.</p>

<p>In structure the expression of life is gained by so
arranging the lines and masses as to give an impression
that power is at work—that something is being
done—done triumphantly yet not without strain and
effort. Every object of utility does something—art
shows it to us in the act. An example may help to
make clear what I mean, and may show how the
principle can be applied to any kind of object which
may be the subject of artistic treatment.</p>

<p>A Greek temple in its simplest external aspect
consists of a quadrilateral group of columns surrounding
a walled shrine and supporting a low-pitched
roof. Nothing could well be simpler than the structural
conditions thus expressed. But the artistic
expression of them is not so simple. This depends
in the main upon the proportion observed between
the pillars and the weight, or apparent weight, above
them. If the pillars are too massive or too numerous
there will be no sense of strain, and if they are too
slender or too few there will be no sense of security.
In either case the expression of vital energy in the
structure will be imperfect, and beauty, which waits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
on the golden moment of the perfect adaptation of
means to ends, will not dwell in that structure.
There is nothing more inartistic than superfluity;
and there is no lesson more emphatically taught by
nature than this. The avoidance of insufficiency is
generally enforced in practice on utilitarian grounds,
but its artistic justification is equally evident. The
golden mean is what we call Just Proportion.</p>

<p>The kind of vitality expressed in Greek architecture
is quite different from that expressed in Gothic,
but the æsthetic basis of both styles is the same; the
principle we have in view will justify any art in
which there is the spirit of life. A Greek temple
shows us power, braced and conscious, but in repose.
There is nothing daring or sensational in its construction.
Stress and thrust answer each other
directly, simply, massively. The stately calm of
such a structure might easily become dull and monotonous
were it not for the delicate sense of proportion
governing the relations of the parts, for the introduction
of slight deviations from strict rectangularity
and symmetry,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> and for the beautiful decoration in
form and colour on frieze, pediment, and capital.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>The principle of the arch was known in very early
times to Pelasgians in Greece and to Etruscans in
Italy, both of whom, no doubt, derived it from the
East. But it was valued more for its utility in certain
constructions than for its artistic quality, and Greek
classical architecture knows nothing of it. It was
freely used in Rome, and here its extraordinary
effect of vital energy as a supporter of weight first
began to be perceived. When Romanesque and
Gothic architecture seized on this principle, the
strength of stonework, heretofore essentially placid,
leapt into vehement life and action. A Gothic cathedral
is the expression of a war of mighty forces held
in equilibrium by their own antagonism. Every part
seems to threaten destruction to some other. There
is, of course, a war of forces in a Greek temple also,
but there the weight and thrust answer each other, as
we have said, directly; a vertical column supports a
horizontal architrave, and <i>must</i> support it, for nothing
can give way without crumbling to pieces. In Gothic
building the counter-stresses meet indirectly, a dead
weight or a thrust is met by the springing curve of
an arch; the whole structure would fall to ruin were
it not for something in the stone which is not mere
solidity, which arises from something vital and energetic
in the scheme of the structure. The expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>sion
of conflict, therefore, as compared with Greek
architecture, is greatly intensified; the serenity of
power has given place to the play of forces rushing
into eager and often tempestuous action, and saved
from being mutually destructive by the control of a
far-seeing design.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>To treat fully the various ways in which structure
may be made expressive of life would need a volume
rather than a chapter. Enough has however been
said to indicate the principle and to suggest a criterion
by which good and bad structure may be judged.
Let us turn to the question of ornament. In European
art it is very common for ornament to be used
as a kind of adjunct to structure; it follows the lines
of structure and accentuates them. In Japanese art,
however, the contours of an object often appear to
determine the ornament applied to it as little as a
window-frame determines the landscape we see
through it. The apparent insouciance of Japanese
ornament is, however, carefully calculated in relation
to the field which is to be covered. In either case
ornament as such—that is to say, apart from whatever
charm of colour and rhythm its individual forms
may have—is to be interpreted as an attempt to give
life by introducing what is so characteristic of life—the
element of change and variety. Popular language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>has hit the mark when it talks of a ‘dead’ wall,
meaning thereby a wall whose surface is unbroken
by openings or ornament. Ruskin has somewhere
spoken of the magnificent work of Ghiberti on the
bronze doors of the Baptistery in Florence as having
been primarily designed to produce “a pleasant
bossiness of surface.” The breaking up of the surface
will not, however, be pleasant unless the forms of the
decoration are in themselves good and instinct with
life.</p>

<p>The beauty which so often arises from the effects
of use and exposure may perhaps seem in some cases
hard to reconcile with the principle which it is here
sought to establish. If aptness for use, it may be
asked, is an element in the beauty of an object of
use, how are we to account for the strong appeal
which the ruin of a noble building certainly makes to
the sense of beauty? For my own part I am
inclined to think that the taste for ruins is often a
sign of a want of taste for art. A beautiful thing is
better whole and sound than in decay. Yet the
spectacle of the silent struggle of strength and
grace with destructive forces has in it a sense of
action, of drama, to which beauty cannot be denied.
Apart from the question of actual decay, every one
feels the æsthetic gain which has been made when a
thing ceases to be blankly new. A natural adornment
has then been added to it. A room that has
been lived in, a piece of silver that has been rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
and handled for a lifetime, the steps of an ancient
building worn by thousands of passing feet, a wall
whose angles are softened and whose surface is
stained by having fronted the sun and rain for many
years—all these have the natural and inimitable charm
produced by the touch of life—they no longer stand
in crude isolation, they are related to the goings-on
of the world.</p>

<p class="tb">Of all the arts there is none which seems to evade
analysis so much as Music; none whose power is at
once so mighty and so mysterious. Saying nothing
it seems to mean everything. We can think of
nothing in the world so lofty, so sweet, so profound
as to be the fit embodiment of what Music conveys
to us. Closely analogous in its outward form to what
in line and colour is called Pattern, we are yet
evidently far short of expressing the whole character
of Music when we say, what in itself is quite true,
that it is beautiful pattern in sound. It has more of
humanity about it than pattern can have. It neither
gives us representations of objects of sense, nor even
definite emotions, but it has a unique power over the
moods of the soul. This power seems to arise first
from its complete control over the resources of movement
and rhythm, secondly from the fact that by
virtue of certain acoustic laws it can excite the sense
of fulfilment, of suspense, of unexpected sweetness,
unexpected failure and depression, in a way open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
no other art which appeals directly to the senses.
But rhythm and movement are the main things in
Music, and the nature of the power which it exercises
by means of them must now be considered.</p>

<p>Rhythm and movement are closely related to each
other, but they are not quite the same thing. The
term rhythm is given to any kind of movement
which is marked by the regular recurrence of
stresses, undulations, beats. This is the essential
character of the movement of life. Action and reaction,
systole and diastole, the vibrations of the
atom, the breaking of sea-waves, the changes of day
and night, the alternations of the seasons—wherever
we look, into things great or small, we find the
same principle of rhythmic movement pervading all.
Man has found out how to turn this principle to
account in his mechanical contrivances, indeed in all
ways in which he endeavours to exercise force on
matter. Once get your force to work rhythmically,
and it will do ten times the work it is capable of
when evenly continuous. Our own bodies and nervous
systems are attuned to the same law. Under
the spell of rhythm the mind is capable of moods
and emotions which without it could never have been
evoked into consciousness. And that makes the difference
between telling a thing in verse and in prose.
Verse arouses the mood in which the subject has
emotional value and significance. Even prose always
becomes more or less rhythmic when impassioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Music has a control unrivalled among the
arts over this element of rhythm. Other arts can
suggest rhythm, Music actually <i>is</i> rhythm—it is the
very pulse of life. It can produce rhythm, moreover,
in a great variety of ways. The mere succession of
sounds is rhythm, but music also has at command
the varying stresses or accents of notes, alternations in
volume of sound, alternations in pitch and quality of
sound. And since a sequence of notes will cling
to the memory, Music can put into rhythmical
relations, not only single notes, but groups of notes,
<i>i.e.</i> musical phrases, and chords, which are musical
phrases played all at once. Music can therefore not
only thunder upon the brain with mighty shocks of
sound, but can enchant it with the most delicate complexities.
The range of its power over rhythm is incomparably
greater and subtler than that of the only
two other arts in which rhythm works directly on the
senses—dancing and metrical verse.</p>

<p>The element of beauty in a rhythmical phrase
seems to depend mainly on the kind of mood it
awakens. There are moods of meditation, moods of
tenderness, moods of ardour, moods of yearning,
moods of gaiety—all these and many more are
under the control of rhythmic phrases. And there
are common-place, self-assertive, bouncing rhythms
which produce corresponding moods, and which may
therefore be called ugly. The precise connexion of
certain phrases with certain moods depending, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
does, on a world of dim associations stretching far
beyond our personal, conscious life, is probably incapable
of scientific statement. In the last result I
think we should find that the characters of different
rhythms are associated with bodily movements, attitudes,
gestures, in short with dancing; but a host of
other associations, branching out from this in many
directions, have introduced a complexity of meaning
which defies analysis.</p>

<p>To turn to the consideration of Movement in art,
we find that the power of rendering this characteristic
of life is shared by Music only with Dancing
and with Literature. By movement in an art-work
I mean movement whose sequences have proportion
and design, progressing by stages linked to each
other through natural and organic associations towards
a significant conclusion. In nature, movement
can be immensely varied in character. It can be
slow or swift, rough and laboured or smooth and
fluent, massive and voluminous or arrowy and intense;
it can leap or undulate, march or dance, soar or
swoop, and each of these kinds of movement means
something to the spirit of man. All these Music
controls, and can order and harmonize at will. It
can represent that in the movement of nature which
goes beyond and overmasters Rhythm; for Rhythm
in itself does not involve Progression; in fact, a perfect
rhythm would forbid it. If Action and Reaction
were always precisely equal, we should have a uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>verse
as stationary as a spinning top—it might be in
vehement action, but it would never develop into
something new.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> Music by its complete command
of the phases of movement can illustrate the progressive
force, the life-impulse in nature, and this not
merely by symbols and intellectual forms, but by
playing directly on the nervous system as a harp-player
on the strings of his instrument.</p>

<p>No art is more sensuous than Music, and none
more abstract, more removed from what are called
realities, in the substance of what it conveys. Its
entire independence of objects of sense as given in
experience, combined with its mastery of the inner
law, the spiritual significance, of life has led to its
being ranked by some as the highest of the arts. I
doubt if such comparisons are profitable, but it is
easy to recognize a sense in which Schopenhauer
speaks truth when he says that the other arts deal
with the shadows of life, Music, however, with its
essence.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p class="tb">Let us now consider the Representative Arts in
the light of the principle which we are trying to
establish. Since they depend on the portrayal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>objects actually found in nature and not created
by the artist, their relation to life is obvious. There
are, however, some minor problems of great interest
and intricacy connected with them, and these we
must briefly touch on.</p>

<p>A great school of artists and art critics has in
recent times maintained that Painting is concerned
with nothing except harmonies of light and colour,
and that subject is therefore completely indifferent
to it save in so far as it affords opportunity for the
rendering of surfaces variously illuminated and composed.
The sun falling on a heap of refuse is on this
theory as much to the artist as when it lights up the
features of Cordelia under her tragic fate. A champion
of this, as it is called, Impressionist school has
explained its particular point of view by suggesting
the manner in which two painters, one of the older
type and one an Impressionist, would treat such a
subject as the death of Agamemnon. The former
would think of the magnitude of the event and the
greatness of the characters of those concerned in it—the
Impressionist would probably try to fix the
attention of the spectator on some note of colour
such as the red robe which a character in the scene
might be wearing.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Can we judge between these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>rival conceptions of the function of the representative
arts?</p>

<p>Let us revert to our formula—Art is the expression
of Life. In the Representative Arts it is the
expression of visible life. If one wishes to paint the
death of Agamemnon it will not do to rely for one’s
effect upon the spectator’s knowledge of that bit of
Greek history and to make one’s art impressive simply
because its allusions are freely recognizable. So far
undoubtedly the Impressionists are right. But on
the other hand, the assassination of a great man is a
bit of life and a very notable and memorable one. The
visible world is, after all, not entirely summed up in
the texture of surfaces under light. Character and
spirit have also their visible manifestations, and the
painter who can render them, as well as the aspects
of physical life by which they are accompanied, is
surely cutting a wider swathe of life than he who
thinks only of the red robe of the actor in a tragic
scene. Goethe satirized a whole false theory of art
when he remarked in a well-known epigram that
“pictures which work miracles are mostly very poor
paintings.” Yet one is reminded of his own feeling
before the painting of St. Agatha, by Raphael, which
he saw on his first Italian journey at Bologna. “I
have marked this figure well,” he writes. “I shall
one day read my <span class="smcap">Iphigenia</span> before her in spirit, and
shall put no words in the mouth of my heroine which
might not have been spoken by this saint.” Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
there not something here for Goethe, for all of us,
beyond painting for the sake of light and colour?</p>

<p>In considering the plastic arts in relation to subject,
the large question of their function as illustration
comes into view. An immense range of art, from
that which deals with religion and history down to
the drawings in our comic journals, evidently presupposes
in the spectator’s mind a background of
information with which the work of art itself does
not and cannot furnish him. A work of this kind
must certainly be said to rely for part of its interest
upon something which is not in the picture. It is
therefore not a pure art product; it is a complex of
artistic with historical or religious or critical interest;
but so long as we do not confuse the different
elements it would be absurd to say that they may
not be legitimately united. Still, the subject of a
picture, as a picture, remains always something which
is in the picture. It would therefore be a contradiction
in terms to speak of a poor picture on a great subject.
If the painting be poor, the subject is poor—the
painter’s intention may have been great, but he has
not expressed it. A reference to portraiture may
help to make the matter clear. An indifferent portrait
of a person held in special love or veneration by
me would, if it were not so bad as to belie him, have
an interest and value for me which it would entirely
lack in the case of one who knew or cared nothing
for the person represented. This superadded interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the interest which travels through the painting to
some concrete person or thing behind it, must be
thought away before a work of art can be judged as
a work of art. The application to religious or historical
art is obvious. Here is a painting in which an uninformed
observer sees a woman and an angel. What
is he to make of it? The painter is evidently representing
a moment of great exaltation and significance.
The woman is receiving a message; and the painter
can tell us, within the limits of his art, not what the
message is, but of what kind it is—sad, or solemn, or
joyful, or tragic. He can make all the accessories of
the theme, the lighting, colour, etc., reinforce his
conception, and the observer can discern, if he has
intelligence in such things, that the painter is putting
before us his conception of the way in which a soul
conceives a mighty destiny. <i>That is the subject</i>; the
universal idea, although the label on the frame be
‘The Annunciation.’</p>

<p>I hope it will not be thought that I am in any
degree seeking to disparage the beautiful art of the
Impressionists in maintaining that the highest art is
that in which there is most of life. Life is so abundant
and rich that one can find it almost anywhere in sufficient
measure to delight and to enchant. Moreover,
the great laws by which life acts and endures, the laws
of rhythm, contrast, harmony, can be amply suggested
in the plastic arts even when dealing with the
most familiar things of earth, and these exalt and
glorify any theme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember to have heard once of a visitor to an
exhibition of paintings by—I need not name him—a
certain well-known purveyor of sensuous religiosities,
a kind of nineteenth-century Carlo Dolci. On
entering he met two ladies passing out through the
ante-room, which happened to be hung with landscapes
by an artist whom I need not hesitate to
name, Mr. Mark Fisher. One of them wished to
pause over these. The other, who walked with wet
eyes and flushed cheek, cried, “Trees, trees! Do
you want me to look at trees after having had my
soul uplifted?” This little anecdote will bear some
thinking over. Can we call an art bad which has
power to uplift the soul? But we have to ask, Was
it really the art which did so, or the allusions in the
art? And again, as in the case of Tolstoy and his
canon of infectiousness, we must ask, What soul? It
is difficult to imagine that the soul capable of being
uplifted by the art of the painter in question would
be very quick to recognize the signs of nobility and
heroic passion in real life. To recognize that the
trees of Mr. Mark Fisher might be worth many
Martyrdoms would be at least a sound beginning of
an artistic education.</p>

<p class="tb">Dancing, so far as it is an art, must be classed
under the Representative Arts. Unlike most of
these it can render movement; and its art is to
display movements in a progressive and a rhythmic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
sequence. It is sculpture in motion. Unless when
combined with Music, however, its range of artistic
expression is not great, beautiful effects are not under
strict control, and in their rapid change the eye
cannot properly take them in. The impression left
by a succession of attitudes seems more confused and
more transitory than that of a musical phrase.</p>

<p class="tb">The question of the place of Literature in the
scheme is one of some difficulty. Unlike all the
other arts, its subject matter is not brought directly
before the senses, but evoked by conventional
symbols which have in themselves no æsthetic value
whatever. Thus in one sense it may be called the
only strictly national art in existence. The most
beautiful poem in the world, though it were graven
in Egyptian basalt, would be a collection of meaningless
scratches if the language in which it was written
were lost. If, however, the language be known,
Literature has not only the power of evoking the
conceptions desired by the maker, but also that
of working directly on the senses by means of the
rhythmic qualities of speech. Still the range of
rhythmic expression in language is so limited that
in itself (<i>i.e.</i> as we might feel it if spoken in an unknown
tongue) it may be regarded as quite subordinate
to the matter conveyed. Strictly, therefore,
we ought perhaps to call Literature neither a Presentative
nor a Representative, but an Evocative art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Within its own circle, however, it falls naturally into
classes corresponding to those of the other arts, for
narrative literature and drama, which deal with
actions and images taken from external life, are
clearly Representative in character, while lyrical and
meditative poetry, which place the maker’s mind,
mood, or passion directly before us, are Presentative.</p>

<p>Literature has one great superiority over the plastic
arts. Like Music, it can render the movement of
life. In the dramatic form this movement can be
brought to bear directly upon the senses. It resembles
Painting and Sculpture in being able to deal
with concrete objects of sense, though, as we have
seen, its method of dealing with them is not strictly
representative. It stands absolutely alone in the fact
that it can render thoughts<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> as well as passions or
moods. I should, then, be inclined to reckon Drama
as the greatest of all the arts in its range of expression,
while at the same time it cannot be claimed for
it that it approaches Music in the control of moods
or in the intensity of effect which audible rhythm
alone seems to command. The conclusion drawn by
Wagner, that the supreme art must be sought in a
combination of Music and Drama, is a tempting one,
but I doubt its validity. The question arises whether
in this combination one or other of the united arts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>does not surrender much of its own special power.
So at least one great poet seems to have felt. “C’est
defendu,” announced Victor Hugo about his dramas,
“de mettre des notes de musique le long de ces vers.”
The poetic use of language has its own conventions
and laws, and these, when used by a master, are so
subtle and so powerful that to set his words to music
is often to produce an effect of distortion. What is
most truly poetic in the language is turned into an
empty mask by withdrawing the underlying substance
to place it under the control of another convention,
another law. One can, no doubt, as in the
case of a Greek chorus, set great poetry to the
measure of a simple chant, or one can unite rhythmic
diction of a broad and simple character with great
music, but the highest poetry and the highest music
do not seem to combine to good purpose.</p>

<p class="tb">In this rapid survey of the arts there are, of course,
large and attractive fields of exploration which have
not been even glanced at. It has been sought on
the present occasion merely to give the clue by which
the arts may be related to the main thesis of this
book. Ethics and Art constitute the two great
fields of what we may call the disinterested activity
of man. They engage his highest powers, they set
him on fire with ardour and sympathy, yet they do
nothing, directly at least, towards satisfying the
primary and personal needs of his nature. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
problem has been to relate them to life, and to give
them a place in a scheme of organic unity. Both
have been seen to have that place only by reference
to something which in one sense is immanent in
nature, and clearly perceptible there, but which in
another aspect is outside “the realm of clock-time
and measuring rod,” the transcendent Whole. All
spiritual ethics, all art which is not of the nature of
a mere record, must in the last resort rely on this
wholeness of things for their justification. But in
the earlier parts of this study we have tried to show
that even the physical organization of nature must
rely on it too; for the driving force of evolution, as
well as the framework of law in which it works, have
been both interpreted as a manifestation of the Will
to live, to act; of the impulse towards the richest
and fullest development of the material, animal, and
spiritual life. It is in this life-impulse that God
reveals Himself in the world of time and space. This
is the visible aspect of His all-embracing unity; this
is His essential relation to earthly things; and this is
the clue to their rational interpretation as parts of a
divine cosmic Order. To learn to apprehend the
vast Purpose with conscious intelligence, to further it
with conscious will and with deliberate faith, is the
sweet and wholesome gospel which Nature preaches
to all who have ears to hear.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>

<p class="center">SUM ERGO COGITO</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OT to encumber the text with too much abstruse
metaphysics, I place here what seem to me some
important corollaries of the position stated at the close of
Chapter I.</p>

<p>If the Universe is not a mere aggregate but a coherent
Whole, then it follows of necessity that the units which
compose it will have relations not only with each other but
also with the Whole. When any of these units reaches the
stage of consciousness it may be expected that it will become
conscious of these relations, and that this consciousness
will, like other things, develop in time to greater and
greater fulness.</p>

<p>But here, from the analytic side of the Kantian philosophy,
comes the warning which tells us that all we can
really know is the stream of sensation which passes through
our mind and which derives the order and coherence it
seems to possess from the laws of that mind. How can we
transcend this apprehension of fleeting appearances, and
attain knowledge of the One, the Real, and of our relations
with It?</p>

<p>To answer this question we must look a little deeper into
the basis of this doctrine of the subjectivity of human
knowledge.</p>

<p>This subjectivity, when we examine it closely, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
(as it is often, I think, supposed) appear to be a special
and inexplicable condition imposed in some external way
on human consciousness. It is a condition absolutely
bound up with the state of existence implied in being a
Person, an ‘I.’ The moment the mind is able to turn
inward upon itself and to separate the thing known or felt
from that which knows and feels, in that moment the
Thing stands a whole infinity away from the ‘I’; they are
separated by the analytic faculty of the Ego and they can
never <i>by that faculty</i> be reunited. The state of being an
‘I’ is essentially a state of analytic consciousness. The
intuitions of space and time are simply the instruments by
which the analytic faculty works, for it is only by their
relations in space and time that things in the world can be
divided and distinguished by the intellect. This analytic
faculty has, it must be noted, an unbounded power of
disintegration. It does not spare even the Ego itself,
which it reduces to a mere flux of sensations. There is no
answer to its destructive logic except the sufficient one,
that this boundless power of analysis in both directions,
inward and outward, is simply a function inevitably bound
up with being an ‘I’ at all—it is because of that function
that I am an ‘I.’ Every being possessing ‘I’-hood must,
<i>eo ipso</i>, be capable of reducing all external things to its
own sensations, and of externalizing its own self. One
cannot be an ‘I’ on any other terms.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that this analytic faculty did not
exist, and that consciousness went on, as perhaps it does in
beasts, by acts of pure intuition, without ever turning
inward to regard itself, without ever making distinctions
between external objects, save as a matter of unreasoned
sense-responsiveness; what would the consequences be
then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Clearly in that case object and subject would be one,
and knowledge, <i>so far as it went</i>, would be absolute knowledge.
But it would neither be true nor false, since without
analysis and comparison there could be no criterion of
truth and falsity. Nor, similarly, could the actions springing
from this state of what may be called Impersonal
Consciousness be either ethically good or bad in relation
to the creature which performed them. In this state,
things in space and time would be seen simply as they
really are—as moments in the life of the Spirit.</p>

<p>Our relations with the Whole, then, must be sought
in this region of pure impersonal consciousness, which
implies entire forgetfulness of Self, entire surrender to the
life-movement of the universe. We can understand now
why man has always had yearnings for this state, and has so
often sought to attain it by false means, by the trance or
ecstasy produced through self-hypnotism, drugs, etc.; means
ultimately and necessarily destructive of their object since
a self-regarding motive lies at the root of them.</p>

<p>If there are illegitimate ways of attaining this state what,
it may be asked, are the legitimate ones? The difficulty of
this question lies in the fact that the state of impersonal
consciousness disappears the moment we begin to think
about it. We live in it, in fact, a great deal more than, in
our states of analytic self-consciousness, we have any idea
of. But as a rule we only live in it with a part of our
nature—the instinctive, animal part. To enter it with our
whole nature, to live in it as Man, two ways have been
found and these we call the way of Religion and the way
of Art; or, if we describe them by the faculties respectively
dominant in each, as the way of Love and the way of
Beauty. Through these essentially harmonizing and synthesizing
powers Man can for a while merge himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
vast ocean of Being, and return from it, renewed and
purified, to the narrow confines of his selfhood.</p>

<p>But return he must; for selfhood is not an accident or a
deformity, not a thing to be despised and shuffled off the
moment we can get rid of it. It, also, is a power of life,
and through it we are enabled to harvest an immense store
of experiences. Through the Ego, no doubt, with its
rapacious egotisms, come sin and wrong into the world;
but, as Heracleitus finely says, “Men would not have
known the name of Justice if these things had not been.”
Moreover, man has to act as well as to be and to feel.
For all complex action, regarding distant ends and involving
choice and discrimination, the faculty of analysis, with
which selfhood is bound up, is absolutely essential. Man
is not to be raised in the scale of being by cutting away
any part of his nature, but by developing the whole harmoniously;
and the analytic self-consciousness is harmonized
with the impersonal consciousness when the one
is used to translate into its own sphere the experiences of
the other—to fashion in the visible and material life some
counterpart of the realities known in the spirit.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B</h2>

<p class="center">CO-OPERATION AND COMPETITION</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N Kropotkin’s <span class="smcap">Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution</span>,
it seems to me (for all that it finds little favour
with some men of science) that real light has been thrown
on certain principles of cardinal importance which had been
obscured in the too exclusive contemplation of the Darwinian
principle of the survival of the fittest in the struggle
for life. Ample proof is given by Kropotkin of the truth of
the following passage:—</p>

<p class="quot">“As soon as we study animals—not in laboratories and
museums only, but in the forest and the prairie, in the
steppe and the mountains—we at once perceive that
though there is an immense amount of warfare and extermination
going on amidst various species, and especially
among various classes of animals, there is, at the same
time, as much, or perhaps even more, of mutual support,
mutual aid, and mutual defence amidst animals belonging
to the same species, or, at least, to the same society.
Sociability is as much a law of nature as mutual struggle.
Of course it would be extremely difficult to estimate, however
roughly, the relative numerical importance of both
these series of facts. But if we resort to an indirect test,
and ask Nature: ‘Who are the fittest: those who are continually
at war with each other, or those who support one
another?’ we at once see that those animals which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>acquire habits of mutual aid are undoubtedly the fittest.
They have more chances to survive, and they attain, in
their respective classes, the highest development of intelligence
and bodily organization. If the numberless facts
which can be brought forward to support this view are
taken into account, we may safely say that mutual aid is
as much a law of animal life as mutual struggle, but that,
as a factor of evolution, it most probably has a far greater
importance, inasmuch as it favours the development of
such habits and characters as ensure the maintenance and
further development of the species, together with the
greatest amount of welfare and enjoyment of life for the
individual, with the least waste of energy” (pp. 5, 6.
1903).</p>

<p>From the mass of facts which Kropotkin has adduced in
support of the above-quoted view, I cannot forbear quoting
one, an observation of his own, relating to a creature of by
no means high organization:—</p>

<p class="quot">“As to the big Molucca crab (<i>Limulus</i>), I was struck
(in 1882, at the Brighton Aquarium) with the extent of
mutual assistance which these clumsy animals are capable
of bestowing upon a comrade in case of need. One of
them had fallen upon its back in a corner of the tank, and
its heavy, saucepan-like carapace prevented it from returning
to its natural position, the more so as there was in the
corner an iron bar which rendered the task still more
difficult. Its comrades came to the rescue, and for one
hour’s time I watched how they endeavoured to help their
fellow-prisoner. They came two at once, pushed their
friend from beneath, and after strenuous efforts succeeded
in lifting it upright; but then the iron bar would prevent
them from achieving the work of rescue, and the crab
would again fall heavily upon its back. After many
attempts, one of the helpers would go in the depth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>tank and bring two other crabs, which would begin with
fresh forces the same pushing and lifting of their helpless
comrade. We stayed in the Aquarium for more than two
hours, and, when leaving, we again came to cast a glance
upon the tank: the work of rescue still continued! Since
I saw that, I cannot refuse credit to the observation quoted
by Dr. Erasmus Darwin, namely, that ‘the common crab
during the moulting season stations as sentinel an unmoulted
or hard-shelled individual to prevent marine
enemies from injuring moulted individuals in their unprotected
state’” (pp. 10, 12).</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C</h2>

<p class="center">IS LIFE WORTH LIVING?</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS grave question is, according to Mr. Herbert
Spencer, one which must be “definitely raised and
answered before entering on any ethical discussion” (<span class="smcap">Data
of Ethics</span>, § 9). He goes on to restate it in the form:
Does life yield “a surplus of pleasurable feeling over painful
feeling?” and he argues that “goodness or badness can
be ascribed to acts which subserve life or hinder life only on
this supposition” (§ 10). But can one really strike a balance
between pleasures and pains in human life? Mr. Spencer
himself admits, later on, that pleasures and pains, “unlike
in their kinds, intensities and times of occurrence, are
incommensurable” (§ 57). Moreover, the maintenance of
life in the present day means passing it on for countless
generations ahead, and how can we feel satisfied that the
conditions then existing will make more for pleasure than
for pain, even assuming that they do so now? The question,
then, whether it is good to maintain life does not
seem capable of philosophic decision on this ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer’s sense of logic, however, seems to me to
be here at fault as well as his fundamental conception of
ethics. The question which he begins by asking is not the
question which he ends by answering. In the original
question, Is life worth living? a comparison is set up
between living and not-living. But we find this merging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
in Mr. Spencer’s mind, into the quite different comparison
of one <i>kind</i> of living with another kind of living—the
pleasurable and the painful. Let us translate the original
question into the language of Mr. Spencer’s ethical system.
In that system “the good is universally the pleasurable”
(§ 10). The word ‘worth,’ then, connotes pleasure, and
the question resolves itself simply into this, Is it more
pleasurable to live than not to live? Seeing that in not-living
there is no pleasure at all, the only possible answer
is an affirmative—the question answers itself. And in fact
this must always be the case whatever connotation we
attach to the word ‘worth,’ for life has at any rate possibilities,
whereas not-living has none. The question, then,
“of late so much agitated,” is really a nonsense question,
and the reason why it is necessarily devoid of meaning will
appear at once when we analyze the terms. For ‘worth,’
‘goodness,’ ‘blessedness,’ ‘pleasure,’ and so forth, are
simply <i>terms of life</i> and have no significance whatever
apart from it. So the question, Is it better to live than
not to live? is merely the same thing as to ask, Is there
more life in living than in not living? Instead, therefore,
of the unverifiable assumption on which Spencer bases his
system of ethics, that life yields on the whole a surplus of
pleasure over pain, we merely affirm the indubitable proposition
that it yields a surplus of life.</p>

<p>From another side than that of the Spencerian ethics,
however, it may be argued, against the conception which we
are trying to substitute for it, that, if Life is something more
than the physical phenomena attending it on earth, if, in
fact, it is what we call ‘immortal,’ we need be at no pains
to preserve it for ourselves or others in the form in which
we find it going on here, since death can merely have the
effect of translating it into another form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>True; but suppose us to hold as lightly by <i>that</i> form as
we are urged to do by this—suppose us to show no persistence
in <i>any</i> of the forms of being into which our life may
pass, what kind of life would be realizable under such conditions
of eternal volatility? Could life ever have risen
above the stage of the <i>Amœba</i> if the <i>Amœba</i> had not the
instinct to maintain itself on earth? Can Man ever hope
to rise to anything higher without a strong element of continuity,
of fixity, of ‘fighting it out on these lines’ in his
feeling about the form of life in which he actually finds
himself? It is through the thousand ties of duty and
service, love and joy, which we form with the visible world
around us that we realize the highest life of which we are
at present capable. A light-minded readiness to snap those
ties would imply an incapacity for forming them. Here, as
always, we find that Nature tells us nothing to any good
purpose unless we look at her as an organic whole. One
cannot live by any isolated principle or factor, however
great and true.</p>

<p class="center">ST. FRANCIS THE POET</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>O one can read St. Francis’s one poem, the <i>Canticle
of the Sun</i>, without feeling that had poetry claimed
and won him in time, his might have been one of the
greatest and sweetest of Italian voices. The story of its
composition has a touching beauty. Towards the end of
his life, when in the deepest dejection over the failure of
his Order to live the life of joyful humility, unworldliness,
and poverty to which he had pledged it, he came, blind
and ill, to S. Clare’s Convent at St. Damien, on his way
to Rieti, where his malady was to be treated. In this
darkest hour of his life the untroubled faith and loving
sympathy of his old friend brought consolation and peace
to his torn spirit. She made him, it is said, a cell of reeds
in the convent garden, where he could be free to come
and go as he wished. “Little by little,” writes Paul Sabatier
in his <span class="smcap">Vie de S. François</span>, “the man of ancient days
revived in him, and at times the Sisters heard the echo of
strange chants, which mingled with the murmuring of the
pines and olives, and which seemed to come from the cell
of reeds.” One day, after a long conversation with Clare,
he had sat down at the monastery table for refection.
Scarcely had he begun to eat when he fell into a kind of
trance. “Praise be to God!” he cried, on coming to himself.
He had completed the <i>Canticle of the Sun</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said that for a week afterwards he forgot his
breviary, and passed his days in repeating to himself the
strophes of his wonderful poem—a work in which, for all
its religious ardour, the note of asceticism is little apparent;
unless one sees it in his usual quaint adoption of the things
of creation into a religious community! I append a literal
translation, omitting two later verses composed for special

<h2>APPENDIX E</h2>

<p class="center">ISABELLA AND CLAUDIO</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE ethics of sex-relations has always formed a crucial
question in ethical systems. Let me recall a remarkable
debate upon it which took place recently between
a champion of the Spencerian system, Dr. Saleeby, and
Mr. W. S. Lilly, who represented, of course, the view of
Catholic orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Mr. Lilly, in an article on Shakespere’s Religion contributed
to the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> for June, 1904, was led
to dwell on “the strikingly Catholic ethos of the play
<span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, informed as it is by the idea,
quite alien from the Protestant mind, of the surpassing
excellence and sacrosanct character of virginal chastity.”
Hazlitt, whom Mr. Lilly takes to represent the typical Protestant
view, had declared himself “not greatly enamoured”
of Isabella’s inflexible purity, and had expressed his want
of “confidence in the virtue that is sublimely good at
another’s expense.” Mr. Lilly added that Spencer’s teaching
would have countenanced Hazlitt’s judgment and enjoined
upon Isabella compliance with Angelo’s desire.
Dr. Saleeby having denounced this as an “outrageous”
perversion of Spencer’s meaning, Mr. Lilly vindicates himself
in a letter to the <i>Fortnightly</i> as follows:—</p>

<p class="quot">“I pointed, in a letter appearing in your July number, to
Mr. Spencer’s express declaration, in the <i>Data of Ethics</i>,
that the elements out of which the conceptions of right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>and wrong are framed are pleasures and pains, and that
‘conduct is considered by us as good or bad, according as
its aggregate results to self or others, or both, are pleasurable
or painful.’ I concluded, therefore, that if we are to go
by Mr. Spencer’s ‘scientific ethics,’ Isabella ought to have
been willing to make the sacrifice of her virginity in order
to prevent the disagreeable feeling which would be caused
to herself through the loss of a beloved brother, to Claudio
through the process of decapitation, and to Angelo through
disappointed desire, and thus to have procured, as ‘aggregate
results,’ a great balance of pleasure over pain to all
concerned” (<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, September, 1906).</p>

<p>Dr. Saleeby’s answer to this is the obvious one that the
Spencerian ethics do not contemplate immediate personal
pleasures and pains, but rather ultimate utility to the race
at large, and that “Isabella’s virtue, if merely by example
alone, would make for the strengthening of the society in
which she found herself.” Mr. Lilly then practically surrenders
his first position—he admits that Spencer’s “scientific
ethics” are intended to have little or no concern with
the immediate sensations of Isabella, Claudio, and Angelo,
but he turns to confront Dr. Saleeby and Spencer from a
new and much stronger position. What claim, he asks,
have “scientific ethics” on the individual? Ultimate
utility for the race might (if one could estimate it correctly)
be taken as giving us the <i>what</i> of moral action, but can it
ever give us the <i>why</i>? Isabella was not thinking of “ultimate
utility” in her refusal, but of the laws that Sophocles
wrote of so memorably, “unwritten and invincible laws
which ever live, and no man knows their birthplace.” She
was not thinking of the effect of her example—her action
would have been, and ought to have been, just the same
though she had had the most complete assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
none but Angelo and herself would ever know the reason
for Claudio’s pardon. The motive which constrained her
was derived from the system of ethics which Spencer’s was
constructed to replace. This new system has never succeeded
in supplying an answer to the demand of the individual
man or woman, ‘What is the advantage of the race
to me that I should sacrifice the least of my inclinations
for its sake?’ But till that piercing question is answered,
all hedonistic systems, however elaborate and perfect their
fabric, are building on “wood, hay, stubble.” Touch their
foundations with the pitiless edge of that question, and in
a moment they are in the dust. So far, in effect, Mr. Lilly.</p>

<p>Before we go on to deal with these conflicting views of
the ethical problem in <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, let us take
a parallel presentation in literature of the same problem,
in which the implied judgment of the dramatist appears
entirely different. Maeterlinck, in his <span class="smcap">Monna Vanna</span>,
shows us a beautiful and high-souled woman, the loving
and faithful wife of the commandant of the city of Pisa.
The city is beleaguered by foes, its power of defence is at
an end, an assault is imminent, and the inhabitants will be
exposed to all the havoc and outrage which attended warfare
in the days when the conceptions so much prized
by Mr. Lilly held undisputed sway. The captain of the
besieging Florentine forces, a great soldier of fortune
named Prinzivalle, had been an ancient playmate of Monna
Vanna, and, unknown to her, had been her ardent lover.
Being entreated for mercy, he sends an ultimatum. Let
Monna Vanna spend a night in his tent, and he will provision
the city and withdraw his army next day. Amid the
indignation and distraction which the cruel dilemma causes
in the household of the prince, Monna Vanna’s resolve
shapes and hardens itself. She decides to sacrifice herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
for the city. But Prinzivalle finds her a woman of marble.
Her soul is so high-strung with heroic devotion that she
regards her body as little as a cast-off rag—she is become
as incapable of fear or shrinking as she is of base desire.
His passion is chilled by the icy completeness of her self-surrender,
while all that is noble in him responds to her
nobility, and the city is saved without the terrible sacrifice
which she was ready to perform.</p>

<p>Such is the tale of Monna Vanna, so far as it concerns
our present discussion. In reading it, it is impossible not
to feel that she was right, just as in reading <span class="smcap">Measure for
Measure</span> it is impossible not to feel that Isabella was right.
What has a system of natural ethics, a system based on the
conception of life and nature put forward in this book, to
say upon the searching ethical question involved in these
two great dramas? It is not an easy nor a pleasant question
to subject to philosophic analysis, but it is a very
important and critical one.</p>

<p>In the first place neither science nor sense will, I think,
agree with Mr. Lilly’s estimate of “the surpassing excellence
and sacrosanct character of virginal chastity.” Virginity,
<i>in itself</i> and apart from all qualifying circumstances,
is the reverse of excellent and admirable. It means death,
not life; it violates nature. What is really sound doctrine
in this connexion is not the sanctity and excellence of
virginity, but the deep degradation of making sexual relations
a subject of barter. Wherever this prevails, whatever
the church and the law may or may not have had to
do with the transaction, the beauty and romance of life is
blighted and destroyed. There is no conquest of culture
which should be guarded more devotedly than the dignity
and sweetness which are brought into the relations of man
and woman by love, as the great poets have understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
that word, love moving in its guarded circle of mutual
trust and intimacy. A life is well lost in defence of this
most sacred treasure of the spirit.</p>

<p>Isabella and Monna Vanna both felt this truth in the
depths of their nature as all good women do. Yet absolute
laws of action can rarely, if ever, be laid down to cover
every individual case. One can conceive either of them
deciding as Monna Vanna actually did. But in the realm of
high tragedy which we are now dealing with, where principles
and actions have a simplicity and integrity rarely found in
common life, it must be felt that neither of them could
have taken up life again as if nothing had happened. Had
they recognized that there were higher reasons stringent
enough to compel them to tread the way to that sacrifice,
they would, I think, like the Roman Lucretia, have
solemnly marked it with their life-blood as an expiation,
and as a warning, were it only to Prinzivalle or Angelo, that
such a thing must not be done save at the most terrible
cost that man can pay. For Isabella, then, the problem
would practically resolve itself into the question whether
she should surrender her own life for that of a single worthless
relative. There was no moral obligation on her to do
that. Had she loved him so intensely as to go willingly to
her doom for his sake, no one could have blamed her; no
one could blame her if she refused, and bade him summon
up his manhood to die for his own sin.</p>

<p>But in Monna Vanna’s case it was not a single life that
was at stake, but the life and honour of a multitude of men
and women with whose protection, moreover, she was, in
part, charged by the high position she held in their midst.
If right and wrong are to be interpreted as Mr. Lilly would
interpret them, solely with regard to the arbitrary commands
of a supernatural Power, then the <i>extent</i> to which a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
action may influence life can hardly be a matter of any
moment. On the other hand, in Spencer’s scheme, with its
criterion of the greatest ultimate pleasure of the greatest
number, hardly anything else can matter except precisely
this question of the extent or area affected by our action.
In the scheme of natural ethics which I am trying to commend,
and which, if I am right, grows logically out of the
conception of a living universe, the element of <i>extent</i> has
its due place in determining action, but none in fixing the
character of the action. And this, it may be observed, is
just what the good sense of humanity has practically
arrived at in its daily judgments and doings. No ordinary
man would be required by any ethical law to lay down his
life as a substitute for another who had no claim on him.
But for a community, or a man such as a sovran, who for
the time represents a community and embodies its interests,
it would be thought base not to die if occasion demanded
it. And so Monna Vanna might rightly feel herself constrained
to do for her city what Isabella was in no way
required to do for a brother, but the quality of the action
would remain in each case the same, and the tragedy could
have ended nobly only in the one stern way.</p>

<p>On the general question of the ordering of sex-relations,
it needs no argument to show that the conditions fixed by
nature forbid them, in the interests of life, to be casual
and fleeting. On the other hand to require that, when
these relations have once been entered into, no vices, no
cruelty, no variance of any kind on either side would
justify the dissolution of the connexion and the formation
of a new one, is surely a superstitious exaggeration of a
principle in itself right and sound. Probably the law and
practice in England at the present day are as good a rough
approximation to a sound marriage system as man has yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
devised; with, however, this large qualification, that cases of
divorce when they come before the law should be heard <i>in
camera</i>. The Anglo-Saxon has not yet got rid of all his
superstitions, and his belief in salvation by publicity is
distinctly one of them.</p>

also abolish the response in plants and metals. Just as animal tissues

poisonous reagents” (p. 188).</p></div>

H. A. Miers, in a lecture on ‘The Growth of a Crystal,’ is reported
to have said, The most wonderful feature of crystals was the manner in
which they grew, just as though they were living things. Two features
deserved special attention. The first was the remarkable power
crystals possessed of healing themselves when mutilated. If a growing
crystal were removed from a solution, broken at one of its corners,
and re-immersed in the solution, it would continue to grow, and as it
grew would restore the missing part, and become once more a completely
symmetrical figure. This power of continuing to grow was
possessed by a crystal even after countless ages, so soon as it was
immersed into the appropriate solution. In this sense the crystal was
immortal, for it never lost its vitality, or power of growing. The other
remarkable feature was the growth of crystals in over-saturated solutions.
In solutions only slightly over-saturated, no spontaneous
generation of crystals was possible. It was true that a solution only
slightly over-saturated would often begin to crystallize, apparently
spontaneously, when exposed to the air, but this was because there
were minute crystal fragments of the dissolved substance floating
about in the air which got into the solution with the dust and so
inoculated the solution with crystal germs, just as the human body
might be inoculated with disease by a disease germ. If these germs
were kept out, the solution would not crystallize until it was very
strongly over-saturated, and then, at a certain strength, it would
suddenly begin to crystallize spontaneously and with great rapidity.—<i>Times</i>,

living substance is almost without exception alkaline or neutral, and
with death changes usually to acid.... Physiological chemistry has

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> The now famous Mendelian Law of Inheritance, first discovered
in 1865 by Mendel, an Augustinian monk and Abbott of Brünn, and
completely ignored till the year 1900, when it was rediscovered by
De Vries and others, is also strongly confirmatory of Weismann’s
analysis of the principle of heredity. According to this law it is
possible, as it were, to isolate any particular characteristic of a species
or even (if heritable) of an individual, and by a definite system of
crossing to attach this characteristic <i>alone</i> to any other variety capable
of crossing with the first. This means that inheritance is governed
by separable units of formative energy. These units are Weismann’s
determinants. The discovery of the methods of turning this principle
to practical account is obviously of great importance for agriculture
and stockbreeding. The law has some inexplicable limitations which
are now closely engaging the attention of biologists. It is impossible
to enter upon the subject more fully here, but a good account of it will
be found in Lock’s <span class="smcap">Recent Progress in the Study of Variation</span>,
and in a brochure, <span class="smcap">An Address on Mendelian Heredity</span>, by W.
Bateson, reprinted from <i>Brain</i>, pt. cxiv, 1906.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The actual stimulus which prompts the division is probably to be
found in the disturbance of equilibrium which arises when the cell is
taking in more nutriment than its digestive system can deal with.
This, of course, does not explain why it should divide instead of dying
of indigestion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The subject of degenerated and lost organs is very fully treated
by M. Edmond Perrier in his <span class="smcap">Traité de Zoologie</span>, pp. 325 <i>sqq.</i> It
may be noted that animals which are <i>fixed</i> usually lack eyes, even in
light. In the depths of the sea, where total darkness reigns except for
the phosphorescence emitted by certain animals, it is found that some
creatures have completely lost their organs of sight, while others have
them extraordinarily developed. Those which have lost them are the
walkers (<i>Crustaceæ</i>); those which show an exceptional development
are the swimmers. This goes to show that the needs of the animal,
rather than the external conditions, are the determining cause.

apparent ... that Schwann went too far in denying the influence of
the totality of the organism upon the local activities of the cells. It
would of course be absurd to maintain that the whole can consist of
more than the sum of its parts. Yet, as far as growth and development
are concerned, it has now been clearly demonstrated that only in
a limited sense can the cells be regarded as co-operating units. They
are rather local centres of a formative power pervading the growing
mass as a whole” (<span class="smcap">The Cell</span>, pp. 58, 9).

What Prof. Wilson, absorbed like most scientists in the consideration

not to be combined in our conception of the divine. But Mill, of

on those who when once betrayed by Reason are apt to fall into
unbelief or superstition, just as those who, when they have found bad
faith among men, may fall into cynicism:—
</p>
<p>
“Would it not, Phaedo,” said Socrates, “be a lamentable condition,
when a certain thesis is true, firm, and intelligible, if a man supporting
something of the kind should find arguments which seemed true at
one time to be false at another, and in the end, instead of blaming
himself or his own want of skill, should, in his ill-temper, make haste
to shuffle off the blame from his own shoulders to Reason itself, and
spend the rest of his life in hating and slandering it, being deprived of
the truth and science of things?”
</p>
<p>
“By Zeus,” said I, “it would be lamentable.”
</p>
<p>
“Let us take heed then, before all else, that we never admit into
our minds the idea that there can be no soundness in reasonings, but
rather believe that we ourselves are not yet sound, and study manfully
and with a will how to be so” (§ xxxix).</p></div>

language, results in a definite alteration in a certain locality of the
brain. The human brain, as an instrument of thought and knowledge,
is, in fact, built up by a long series of purposeful efforts beginning in
early infancy. These efforts do not, of course, originate in the matter
of the brain itself, nor can the different nerves, which bring it messages
from the outside world, carry with them anything of the nature of conscious
purpose and will. These arise from Personality. I may refer
for a full and very interesting treatment of this subject to Dr. W. H.
Thomson’s work, <span class="smcap">Brain and Personality</span> (1907).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_149" id="Footnote_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149"><span class="label">[149]</span></a> I may draw attention in this connexion to a striking and valuable
study of the effect of American democracy on Jewish immigrants published
in the <i>Times</i> of January 4, 1908. As regards Catholicism,
it appears from a comparison of the statistics of emigration from Ireland
with those of Catholicism in the U.S.A. that about 50 per cent
of the Irish Catholics abandon their religion in the New World. The
Irish are also shown by the criminal statistics of the States as well as
by the observation of students of the criminal classes like Mr. Josiah
Flynt, to furnish a far greater proportion of criminals in that country
than obtains in the case of any other nationality contributing to its
population. Yet they also give to American life some of its very best
elements, and they are notoriously the most crimeless of people at
home. The degradation of character commonly produced by Christianizing
the Hindu is so uniformly attested by residents in India that
it cannot be discredited. See, in this reference, an article entitled
‘The Failure of Christian Missions in India,’ by Dr. Josiah Oldfield,
<i>Hibbert Journal</i>, April, 1903. Of course it may be said that the
original error lies in the identification of ritual and observance with
religion and morality.</p></div>

naturally leads to still more lamentable perversions by being practised
by persons who have never withdrawn themselves from ordinary social
relations. Thus a Catholic priest has lately given as an instance of the
“spiritual tendency and unworldliness of the Irish peasant” the case of a
farmer’s wife, the mother of a large family, who, by a long course of
secret austerities, brought herself “to an untimely grave, and, no doubt,”
adds the reverend author, “a martyr’s crown.” To keep herself in
health and do her duty to her husband and children would, it appears,
have been “worldliness.” Such cases, we are told, are not uncommon.

when we think, for instance, of the sympathetic treatment of the
Trojans in Homer, or the nobility of feeling about the Moors which
runs through <span class="smcap">The Cid</span>. A great art may glorify battle, but cant and

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_176" id="Footnote_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> It is very hard to understand why, when Athens was producing
some of the greatest art of the world and the profoundest philosophic
thought, the attempt to develop a philosophy of the arts should not
have succeeded better than it did. Plato felt instinctively that he had
entangled himself in a chain of false logic, and he appeals to Art
to vindicate its truth, if it can. He would yield himself to its “enchantment”
only too gladly were it not “a sin to betray what seems
to us the cause of truth.” But it never occurs to him that what
the painter is really copying is not the carpenter’s bed, but the
heavenly. Aristotle, on the other hand, well knew that there is something
creative about art. Witness his famous saying that “Poetry is
both a more philosophic and a higher thing than History, since Poetry
looks at things in a universal, History only in a particular aspect”
(<span class="smcap">Poetics</span>, IX, 3). He was, however, still too much under the control
of the popular view of Art as Imitation to be able to see the full scope
of his own principle. Thus, he excluded Architecture from the realm
of Art because it did not imitate anything in nature.</p></div>

Whitman, “in either of my two volumes, because human thought,
poetry or melody, must leave dim escapes and outlets—must possess a
certain fluid, aerial character, akin to Space itself, obscure to those of
little or no imagination, but indispensable to the highest purposes.
Poetic style, when address’d to the Soul, is less definite form, outline,
sculpture, and becomes vista, music, half-tints, and even less than half-tints.
True, it may be architecture; but again it may be the forest
wild-wood, or the best effects thereof, at twilight, the waving oaks and
cedars in the wind, and the impalpable odour” (Preface to <span class="smcap">Two
Rivulets</span>, p. 13).
</p>
<p>
Let me set beside this a passage from that singularly beautiful book,
Kakasu Okakura’s <span class="smcap">Ideals of the East</span>: “Shakaku in the fifth
century lays down six canons of pictorial art, in which the idea of the
depicting of Nature falls into a third place, subservient to two other
main principles. The first of these is ‘the Life-movement of the Spirit
through the Rhythm of Things.’ For art is to him the great Mood of
the Universe, moving hither and thither amidst those harmonic laws of
matter which are Rhythm” (p. 52).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_180" id="Footnote_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_180"><span class="label">[180]</span></a> I may refer in passing to the researches of A. C. Haddon and
Henry Balfour, who have made it seem at least highly probable
that all decorative forms originated in the copying of natural objects.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_181" id="Footnote_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_181"><span class="label">[181]</span></a> F. C. Penrose showed in 1851 that all the quasi-horizontal lines
in the Parthenon are really arcs of circles, that the ‘entasis’ or
swelling of every pillar is the true arc of an hyperbola, and that there
is not a true right-angle nor a strictly vertical column in the building.
All good Greek buildings are similarly full of “curves, leaning faces,
irregular spacings, and other optical refinements” (<span class="smcap">Investig. of the
Princs. of Athenian Architecture</span>). This principle, called by
Ruskin ‘life’ (<span class="smcap">Seven Lamps</span>) and by some ‘symmetrophobia,’ was
most daringly applied in mediæval building. A very striking and
well illustrated series of articles on the subject was contributed by
Mr. W. H. Goodyear to the <i>Architectural Record</i>, Vol. VI, 1896-7.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_182" id="Footnote_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_182"><span class="label">[182]</span></a> I am indebted in connexion with these remarks on Gothic architecture
to a very interesting paper by Mr. L. March Phillipps in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i> for September, 1907.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_183" id="Footnote_183"></a><a href="#FNanchor_183"><span class="label">[183]</span></a> For example, when molecules first grouped themselves (supposing
that was how it came about) into the form which resulted in living
protoplasm, their action was one of a chemico-physical nature, but the
response is not expressible in purely chemico-physical terms. Similarly
when sensation first appeared in protoplasm.</p></div>

M. Mauclair, “becomes the sole subject of the picture; the interest of
the object upon which it plays is secondary. Painting thus conceived
becomes a purely optic art” (p. 32). “The principal person in a
picture,” said Manet, “is the light” (p. 42).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_186" id="Footnote_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> No one who has seen “Le Penseur,” by Rodin, will doubt that
plastic art can render Thought. But literature alone could tell us
what he is thinking.</p></div>

<p class="quot padr1 padl1"><i>These are the headings to the chapters, but each chapter is subdivided
into a number of sections, with marginal references, so as
to make the book of value as a work of reference.</i><br /><br />
<i>Lancet.</i>—“We consider this small book with its big title extremely well
done.”<br /><br />

<i>Tribune.</i>—“The book is remarkable for its extreme lucidity. It is
alluring and instructive, and is supplemented by a set of illustrations which
correspond in every way to the merits of the text.”<br /><br />

<i>Guardian.</i>—“These interesting questions are dealt with by one who
understands them, and has investigated many of them experimentally in a
lucid, almost conversational style, but in good and attractive English, so
that we can heartily recommend this volume to all who desire to learn something
of what evolution really means, but are deterred by the technicalities
of text-books.”<br /><br />

<i>Outlook.</i>—“Mr. Headley’s volume on Evolution is a charming book, not
simply indeed for the student who wants an introduction to the theory of
evolution, but for the general reader. It is a model of what a scientific
work for the general public ought to be, readable and interesting, but
withal accurate and well informed, and in this case full of touches of the
imagination of the kind which illuminate knowledge.”</p></td>
